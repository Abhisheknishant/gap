# Contributing to gap-git

The GAP Community welcomes pull requests, bug reporting, and bug squashing!
However, we cannot do it all ourselves, and want to make it as easy as
possible to contribute changes.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you are familiar with [Git](http://git-scm.com/book).
1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
1. Make sure you are familiar with [GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/).
1. Make sure you can install GAP.

## Issue Reporting

Before you report an issue, or wish to add cool functionality please try
and check to see if there are existing
[issues](https://github.com/gap-system/gap-git/issues) and
[pull requests](https://github.com/gap-system/gap-git/pulls).
We do not want you wasting your time duplicating somebody's work!

## The Campsite Rule

A basic rule when contributing to GAP is the **campsite rule**:
leave the codebase in better condition than you found it.
Please clean up any messes that you find, and don't
leave behind new messes for the next contributor.

## Contributing to the library.

We do not want you wasting your time nor duplicating somebody's work!

Developers should be prepared to wait until their PR has been discussed
and authorized prior to the PRs inclusion.

## Making Changes

GAP development follows a straightforward branching model.

 * Fork our [main development repository](https://github.com/gap-system/gap) on github
 * Clone your fork to your local machine:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:<your github user name>/gap.git
```
 * Add `gap-system/gap` as a remote upstream
```
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:gap-system/gap.git
```
 * Ensure your existing clone is up-to-date with current `HEAD` e.g.
```
$ git fetch upstream
$ git merge upstream/master
```
 * Create, and checkout onto, a topic branch on which to base you work.
   * This is typically done from the master branch.
   * For your own sanity, please avoid working on the `master` branch.
 ```
 $ git branch fix/master/my_contrib master
 $ git checkout fix/master/my_contrib
 ```
 * Make commits of logical units.
 * Check for unnecessary whitespace with
```
$ git diff --check
```
 * Make sure your commit messages are along the lines of:

        Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes

        More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
        characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
        subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
        line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
        the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
        two together.

        Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

        - Bullet points are okay, too

        - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
          single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

 * Make sure you have added any necessary tests for your changes.
 * Run all the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
```
$ make testinstall
$ make testall
```
 * Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
```
$ git push origin fix/master/my_contrib
```
 * Go to GitHub and submit a pull request to GAP

From there you will have to wait on one of the GAP committers to respond to the request.
This response might be an accept or some changes/improvements/alternatives will be suggested.
We do not guarantee that all requests will be accepted.

## Increasing chances of acceptance.

To help increase the chance of your pull request being accepted:

* Run the tests.
* Update the documentation, tests, examples, guides, and whatever
  else is affected by your contribution.
* Use appropriate code formatting for both C and GAP.
