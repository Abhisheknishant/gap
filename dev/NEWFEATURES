# This file should record, at least, all implemented and documented
# changes (new features, performance improvements, ...) that will
# probably be released in GAP 4.5. Of course some changes will not
# need documentation. Developers should add, at least a one-line
# description and their initials. Adding a longer description means
# that you are less likely to be pestered for one at release time.

# You may also record here planned or proposed developments, or
# implemented but not yet documented developments. Please indicate the
# status of each development you add.  This list of new features (not
# all might be worth mentioning) will help in preparing the next
# release announcement)

The behaviour of 'Info' can now be configured InfoClass-wise, see
'SetInfoHandler'. (FL)

New function 'CrcString' (FL)

Corrected documentation of 'Jacobi' (FL)

New method for `Factorization' that can deal with larger groups
(Nicholas Rohrbacher, AH)

New method for subgroup lattice based on lifting also in the case of
nonsolvable groups. (AH)

New function to compute presentation for group based on chief series (which
produces nicer presentations than composition series). (AH)

Small speed improvements in the 1-Cohomology (AH)

Functions for computing continued fraction expansions and continued
fraction approximations of algebraic numbers. (SK)

A method for computing symbolic names for finite groups,
available via Name( <G> ).
(SK, based on GAP3 code by Markus PÃ¼schel and Sebastian Egner)

The new function AClosestVectorCombinationsMatFFEVecFFECoords (see
documentation) which had been requested by David Joyner. (SL)

`Enumerator' method for free magmas, `Iterator' method for partitions (TB)

`Iterator' methods for tuples and cartesian products (AK)

The scheme for variable names for polynomials has been changed to avoid
accidentally creating different variables with the same name. (AH)

A simple method for multivariate polynomial factorization has been added (DJ, AH)

Module isomorphisms and automorphisms can now be computed by the MeatAxe
(port of Michael Smith's code in the `autag' package of GAP3.) (AH, based on
code by Michael Smith)

Speed improvement to `CompatiblePairs' (and thus to automorphism group and
extension calculations for solvable groups. (AH)

Better code for automorphism groups of fitting free groups. (AH)

Basic methods for accessing the functionality for floats implemented
in the kernel (not yet documented). (SK)

Primitive groups added to degree 2499. Groups of affine type are now
stored as matrix groups; group names will have changed. (CMRD)

Provide internal functions ObjInt_Int and ObjInt_UInt and use them
for FuncLENGTH to correctly report the length of long strings. (MN)

Added functions `SmallSimpleGroup' and `AllSmallNonabelianSimpleGroups'
returning small-degree permutation representations of simple groups
of given orders less than 10^6. (SK)

In Windows version `SetHelpViewer' accepts argument "browser" 
to open HTML help books using the Windows default application 
(typically, a web-browser). (AK)

Better support for workspaces:
- replaced `.gaprc' by `gap.ini' and `gaprc' in GAP root directories
  (different kinds of initializations),
  support a root directory `~/.gap',
- changed handling of command line options for workspaces,
- changed banner showing more information and shown also with workspaces

Changed order of reading files when packages are loaded:
- If possible then read needed and suggested packages completely before the
  implementation part of the current package is read.
- Now the implementation part of the GAP library can be read after the
  declaration part of packages.
