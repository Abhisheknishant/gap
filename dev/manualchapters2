% Chapter 2: The Help System
% File: ./help.xml (line 12)

% Comments:
-2MN Browsing through the Sections:
  - ``?< displays the section preceding the previously shown section,
    and ?> takes you to the section following the previously shown one.''
    --This is not true for GAPDoc format manuals, here the help is subsection
    oriented, i. e., if one asks for a particular topic then the corresponding
    subsection is opened (not the beginning of the section that contains this
    subsection), and if one goes further with ?> then the help is opened at the
    following subsection.
    (This holds also if one has used the pager facilities for moving forwards
    to the end of the whole chapter, say.)
  - ``?<< takes you back to the first section of the current chapter,
    which gives an overview of the sections described in this chapter.''
    --Is this really true for all chapters?  (Would it be useful to state this
    as a rule for writing documentation?)
-2MN The description of the commands ``?[book:]sections'' and
  ``?[book:][chapters]'' is not sufficient.
  If no book is prescribed then the table of contents of the first book is
  shown, quitting the help leads to the table of contents of the second book
  and so on.
  What is the difference between ``?sections'' and ``?chapters''?
  What is the difference between ``?IO:'', ``?IO:sections'', ``?IO:chapters''?
  For GAPDoc books there seems to be no difference,
  for other book such as the book for the `Hopf' package,
  there are a ``Table of Chapters'' and a ``Table of Sections''.
  (BTW, shouldn't it be ``Contents'' rather than ``Content'', in the text of
  this section as well as in the displayed help pages?)
-2 Changing the Help Viewer:
  - ``dvi: The standard output format of &TeX;. Only useful if &TeX; is
    installed on your system.'' --Is &TeX really needed for using xdvi?
  - ``HTML: ... Some books  use special  symbol fonts for  formulae and
    need an appropriate web browser for correct display.'' --Which book
    formats use symbol fonts? And in this case, is the choice of the browser
    the problem or the browser configuration (see below)?
-2 SetHelpViewer:
  - ``Furthermore the  terminal (window) should use a fixed  width font and
    we suggest to take one with <C>ISO-8859-1</C> (also called <C>latin1</C>)
    encoding.'' --Is this still true?
  - ``Note, that for  some books the browser must be configured to use symbol
    fonts.'' --Does this hold only for non-GAPDoc books? (Be specific!)
  - ``Formulae which use symbol fonts may be unreadable.'' --Tell in which
    formats symbol fonts may appear.
  - Why must TeX (LaTeX?) be installed in order to use xdvi?

% Chapter 3: Running GAP
% File: ./run.xml (line 18)

% Started: January 24, 2008

% Comments:
-2* Are the following statements about the command line options `-m' and `-o'
  correct:
  ``Under UNIX the default amount of memory allocated by &GAP; is 24 MBytes.''
  ``Under UNIX the default amount is 256 MBytes.''
  (Is it reasonable at all to mention the values in the text,
  i.e., wouldn't it be better to point to those components in `GAPInfo'
  where the current values --not only the default values-- can be looked up?
  Note for example that the script for starting GAP may involve a different
  default.)
  best: write a sentence that one should start GAP and look at GAPInfo.<something>!
-2*MN The section `Command Line Options' mentions GASMAN, malloc, sbrk,
  and the GAP compiler; is this still correct?
-2 The section about the Mac states
  ``Presently, &GAP; for MacOS also supports Mac path names, but this may
  change in the future.'' --what is the status here?

  E. g., is the command line history really limited to about 8000 characters?

-2* Section `PrintTo':
  Is the ``operating system dependent maximum on the number of output files
  that may be open simultaneously'' still usually 14?
  (Section `Read' claims that it is usually 15.)

% Comments:
-2 The documented function COPY_LIST_ENTRIES should not be written with
  capital letters only.
  (And the declaration line is too long, and looks ugly.)
-2* GAPDoc problem:  Entering `?List' now opens the entry for GAPDoc's <List>
  element (the only exact match since the function `List' now has two
  variants with labels)
  [This is also a problem for `IsDocumentedFunction'.]

% Started: May 25, 2009

% Comments:
-2 Change the introductory section ``In GAP 3 these methods have been
  available for AgGroups only; ...  At the current state of implementations
  the methods for polycyclic groups can only be applied to finite groups.
  However, a more general implementation is planned.'', as follows:
  - State that the pc group methods are applicable to permutation groups and
    matrix groups that are  known to be solvable, and that the methods are
    especially efficient for groups whose elements are represented w.r.t. a
    pc presentation (crossref. to the chapter in question).
    Perhaps add a *VERY SHORT* remark about the different situation in GAP 3,
    for example via ``contrary to GAP 3'', but this should not be very
    prominent; in fact I would completely omit it.
  - Can the last two sentences be replaced by a reference to the package
    `Polycyclic'?

-2 In the introductory section, adjust the statement ``At the current level
  of implementation GAP can only deal with finite pc groups. This will be
  extended in near future.'', cf. the comments to Chapter 43.
-2 `IsParentPcgsFamilyPcgs':
  another reference to GAP 3 which should be omitted or at least should be
  made less prominent (cf. Chapter 43)
-2 `PcGroupCodeRec':
  The statement and the example belong to `PcGroupCode'.

-2 Section `Standardization of coset tables':
  A ``caveat paragraph'' explains the difference between the lenlex
  standardization of coset tables used in GAP and the semilenlex
  standardization ``that we have used in earlier GAP versions'';
  say precisely in which GAP version the change of concepts happened.
  (In subsection `CosetTableStandard', essentially the same is said;
  avoid this.)
  In subsection `StandardizeTable', ``old'' and ``new'' convention are
  mentioned --this is not helpful, change this.
