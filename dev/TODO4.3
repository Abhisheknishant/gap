Things to change from 4r3pre2 to the release
============================================

Remember to change the gap -h text as described in 
mkdistrib/HOWTO

FL:


1) What is the status of implementation of the redefined list arithmetic?
(definition, mutability and compressed-ness of result, ...)
Should the file tst/arithlst.tst be reconsidered to provide a serious test?

2) Recently we detected that there is a major problem with file/stream
access. Some functions work with the C-interface of buffered streams and some
with the non-buffered. I think Max has made the problems clear in a mail
some time ago. Shouldn't this be resolved for GAP4.3? I think, adding new
interfaces to external databases and programs is an important task during
the lifetime of 4.3.

3) I could not solve the compilation problem for a 64 bit version of GAP on
an UltraSparc III machine. On the other hand it would be good to have such a
GAP available. No idea, how to proceed.

AH:

The two missing irreducible solvable groups  (Burkhards mail) should be
added. (They are already appended in the list of primitive groups.)

Potentially the problems with loading the cryst package (greg reported
problems which wree due to messing with the package loading mechanism. If
this cannot be resolved, there is a small chance that we have to add another
documented hook to the package loading mechanism.
