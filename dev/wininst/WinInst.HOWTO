Preparing GAP Windows Istaller HOWTO
====================================

To prepare Windows installer, you need to have one of the 
Windows versions (e.g. 98, 2000 or XP), and the NSIS program.

Following the NSIS manual, NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install 
System) is a tool that allows to create installers for Windows.
It is released  under an open source license and is completely 
free for any use. It is small, fast and efficient. While other 
installers may add hundreds of kilobytes or several megabytes 
to installer data, an overhead of the full featured NSIS 
installer is only 34 KB. You can create a single installer that
is compatible with Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 
NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

The latest version of NSIS can be downloaded from the following
address: http://nsis.sourceforge.net

To create a NSIS installer, first you need to have an NSIS 
script. An NSIS script is a text file with special syntax. 
NSIS scripts has an extension "nsi". You can edit scripts with 
every text editor. 

The second stage is to compile the script. NSIS has two ways of
doing this. The most convenient is to use MakeNSISW - a graphical 
user interface to NSIS. To compile the script, you shoud do one
of the following:
 - Select "Load Script" in the "File" menu
 - Drag the .nsi file into MakeNSISW window
 - Right click on the .nsi file and choose "Compile NSIS Script"

The second way is to use MakeNSIS on the command line. The syntax 
of the makensis command is:

makensis script.nsi

(the directory containing makensis should be in the search path).


To make the GAP installer for Windows:
--------------------------------------

1) create the subdirectories 'gap', 'htmie', 'tools', 'xtom' in 
the directory with gap.nsi script

2) unpack each of the GAP archives (gap, htmie, tools, xtom)
to the corresponding folder (i.e., to obtain gap/gap4r4/bin, 
htmie/gapr4r/doc/htmie etc.). Note that you should use zoo 
or winzip archives.

3) remove the executable file for MacOS

4) put gapicon.ico, gaprxvt.ico and GPL.txt files in the folder
with gap.nsi script

5) compile the script

6) perform test installation with various components and compare it 
with the content of source directories


To make the GAP packages installer for Windows:
-----------------------------------------------

1) create the subdirectory 'pkg' in the directory with packages.nsi 

2) unpack packages archive there (to have pkg/ace, pkg/aclib etc.).
Note that you should use zoo or winzip archive.

3) compile the script

4) perform test installation and compare it with the content of 'pkg'


To make the GAP update for Windows:
-----------------------------------

1) create the subdirectory 'fix' in the directory with fix.nsi

2) unpack the update archive there (to have fix/lib, fix/tst etc.).
Note that you should use zoo or winzip archive.

3) remove the directory with Mac binary

4) compile the script. 

5) perform test installation of update in a separate folder to check 
   that it is identical to the original zoo or win.zip archive

6) perform test installation of update above the GAP installation. 
   Check that all relevant files were updated and that the GAP version 
   number was increased in:
- GAP folder in Start Menu
- Installed programs


If things go wrong:
-------------------

Since scripts use *.* masks for files, there will be no problem 
if new files were added to the system or packages, but scripts 
will require correction if new directories were added or removed.
In this case you need to find the appropriate place in the script
and add or remove an appropriate pair of commands for the 
directory you need to add or remove. For example, for the 10th
layer of Small Groups Library, the script has the following lines:

  SetOutPath $INSTDIR\small\small10
  File gap\gap4r4\small\small10\*.*

Note also that at the end of each section there should be a 
command to restore the initial output path:

  SetOutPath $INSTDIR 


Making exe-files in Linux
-------------------------

I managed to build exe-files in Linux with Windows version of NSIS
installed in WINE. To do this, you need to install WINE, then to
install Windows version of NSIS under Wine. After this you should be
able to login to the Linux machine in the terminal window and build
exe-archive using the GAP.NSI scrtipt, using the command of the form:

wine ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/NSIS/makensis.exe GAP.NSI

From my experience, it was working, but not very stable. Shorter files
we normally created, with longer archives sometimes compression was
terminated with an incomplete file. Maybe it was a problem of NSIS,
or of WINE, or interaction with other processes running on the server
(I didn't tried in the dedicated machine). In my opinion, it is better 
to use native Windows machine, if available.
