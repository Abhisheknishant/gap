To make a CD image for GAP

Copy the whole of the FTP site.

Delete the deposit and old subdirectories

Delete all but the most recent version of each archive in the tar.bz2, tar.gz, 
zoo and win.zip directories.

Under 4.4.6 this gets you down to abou 878M. 

Now go through the four */packages/ directories, 
removing all but the latest copy of each package. This gets down to about 650MB,
which should fit on a CD.

Use xcdroast, or other favourite tool to make a CD image. 

Leave it on /pub/gappre on the FTP site.

Lots more could be done -- nice CD specific README files, covers,
live CDs, etc.
