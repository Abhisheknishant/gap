<A NAME="declare"><H2>How do I create a module</H2></A>
The proposed module should have a clear description, a clear interface and
clear author/maintainership.

A module proposal consists of three steps:
<OL>
<LI>The module (name, functionality, involved files, authors/maintainers) is
proposed in gap-dev.
<LI>Someone else has to second this module
<LI>If no objections remain and the module has been seconded a month after
the proposal the module is accepted:
<UL>
<LI>
A mail ``MODULE-ACCEPTED'' has to be sent to gap-dev.
<LI>
The module is added (at the end) to dev/MODULES.
<LI>
The module is added (alphabetically except for the initial entries) to doc/tut/authors.tex
</UL>
</OL>

<A NAME="chg"><H2>How can I change things in an established module</H2></A>

Ask the authors/maintainer(s) before doing any non-trivial changes. If you
are author or have the approval changes proceed like ordinary changes.
