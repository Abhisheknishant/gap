%W  Update                      GAP Maintenance
%%
%%
%Y  Copyright (C)  2005,  Lehrstuhl D f√ºr Mathematik,  RWTH Aachen,  Germany
%%
%%  This file is intended to list the changes that will be published with
%%  the next GAP release.
%%
%%  The information is used for producing:
%%  - the update announcement
%%  - additions to `tst/bugfix.tst'
%%  - an HTML page that lists known bugs and intended new features
%%  - an entry in the `Changes' manual describing the new release.
%%
%%  This file contains two sections: 
%%  - changes in the stable branch (e.g. to make GAP 4.5.7 after GAP 4.5.6)
%%  - changes in the default branch (e.g. to make GAP 4.6 after GAP 4.5.17)
%% 
%%  How to make sure that the change goes into right place:
%%
%%  - for adding a change in the stable branch, call 'hg update stable-4.5',
%%    then just copy one of the templates below to the end of the stable
%%    branch section and enter the relevant information.
%%
%%  - for adding a change in the default branch, call 'hg update default',
%%    then just copy one of the templates below to the end of the default
%%    branch section and enter the relevant information.
%%
%%  DO NOT enter descriptions of any changes in the default branch into
%%  the version of this file from the stable branch !!!
%%
%%  Formal rules for this file, to allow simple parsing by a script:
%%          - lines starting with `%' are comments and are ignored
%%          - lines starting with `!' describe the type of information
%%            in the following lines until the next `!'-line (therefore, 
%%            information must be entered *after* and not *in* `!'-lines)
%%          - each entry must be finished with an `! End' line, otherwise
%%            the order of entries is irrelevant
%%          - the text behind the `!' is case and whitespace insensitive
%%
%%  To describe the change, you need to fill in least the following fields
%%  in one of the templates below: "Date", "Changed by", "Type of Change",
%%  "Description" and "Changeset". Also, fill in "Reported by", if
%%  applicable, and, if relevant, provide some code in test file format 
%%  in "Test Code".

%%%%%%% Template with explanatory comments (the shorter one is below) %%%%%%%
% [Required] When the change was checked in, format 'yyyy/mm/dd':
! Date

% [Required] Initials should suffice here:
! Changed by

% [Optional] Only if applicable:
! Reported by

% [Required] Choose one or more entries and/or add new ones; 
% but always use either the 'Fix:' or the 'New:' prefix
! Type of Change
Fix: wrong result
Fix: inappropriate error message
Fix: infinite loop
Fix: efficiency issue
Fix: crash
New: extended functionality
New: new functionality
New: improved documentation

% [Required] For the description use plain text
! Description

% [Optional, but highly desirable] If possible, provide some code 
% in test file format which allows to check if a change was applied 
% to an installation. Provide input and output, including prompts, 
% exactly as in a GAP session.
! Test Code

% [Optional] If possible, provide some information about a temporary fix, 
% workaround etc., maybe with a link to some longer description or a file 
% with some code. Use plain text here.
! Prefetch

% [Required] Describe here how to find out where the changes were made. 
% - for immediate changes in the stable branch, specify changed file(s).
%   Adding the entry describing the change should be a part of the same 
%   commit as the change itself, so that adding/merging/backing out the 
%   change fix will keep dev/Update in sync. If you will need to revisit 
%   this change before the next GAP release, please update also its entry 
%   in dev/Update file, specifying the full hexadecimal changeset id 
%   (160-bit identifier) of the previous change(s).
% - for changes made in feature branches, the change to dev/Update should
%   be made in the same feature branch, so it will be merged into default
%   or stable branch together with actual changes and reverting the merge
%   will also revert the dev/Update file. Specify here the name of the 
%   feature branch and possibly the full hexadecimal changeset id (160-bit 
%   identifier) of the latest revision of the code in this branch before 
%   the merge. 
% Since by default, Mercurial displays only the first 12 characters of
% the full hexadecimal changeset id, to see the full version, use --debug 
% option, e.g. 'hg --debug log'. Do not use the short revision number 
% since it makes sense only within your clone.
! Changeset

% [Required] Finish your entry with this:
! End
