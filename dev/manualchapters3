-3c ``At some time, an options predicate or something of the kind may be added
  to method selection.''
  Is this still intended?
  Explain that (currently) options are ignored by the method selection;
  only arguments of the function call are evaluated by the method selection.
-3c ``An alternative to this system is the use of additional optional arguments
  in procedure calls. This is not felt to be adequate because many procedure
  calls might cause, for example, a coset enumeration and each would need to
  make provision for the possibility of extra arguments. In this system the
  options are pushed when the user-level procedure is called, and remain in
  effect (unless altered) for all procedures called by it.''

  This is misleading: Additional optional arguments ARE used in most places,
  and in fact they are a clean way to transfer parameters to subroutines,
  whereas global options are in danger to be overwritten by someone else
  who tries to use the same mechanism.
  (I think optional arguments should be preferred to global options whenever
  one designs new code.)
  In my eyes, global options are a convenience not for the user but only for
  the programmer, in the situation that (s)he wants to carry a new parameter
  from a top level function to a low level function (a new method, say)
  without changing the intermediate function calls.
  The best reason for using global options in such a situation is that one
  simply cannot change the existing GAP library code that does not know about
  the new parameter.

(I admit that I do not like global options at all, in particular the
extended function call syntax.
In my eyes, this mechanism works only because it is used rarely.
If it will become more popular then eventually it will break its own
functionality.)

-3c There is a section title ``Comparisons of Lists'' and an index entry
  ``comparisons!of lists'' (i.e., ``of lists'' is a subkey);
  the idea behind the index entry is that several subkeys will appear
  under the index entry ``comparisons''.
  A side-effect is that the online help finds two matches, one for the
  section and one for the index entry, which point to the same place.
  How to deal with this?
-3c* It is confusing to use `last' as the name of an argument, but this
  occurred in some functions for ranges;
  which better name could be used?
  Also, should we better generally *forbid* assigning to `last', `last2' etc.?
  (Also `rec' should not be used as the name of an argument in the
  documentation; GAP does not admit `rec' as an argument name!)
  And should `last', `rec', and other dangerous names be forbidden in
  <A> elements?
-3c If ranges will be generalized in GAP 4.5,

-3c `PositionSorted':  The old documentation contained the statement

  If the definition really intends to describe the general concept of an

  However, since it is not obvious what is ``the structure'' of a domain,

  I think this is nonsense, and have commented is out.
  (For example, there is no GAP function `ExampleActionFunction'.)
-3c `OnLines' and other action functions promise an error when the argument
  point is not normalized,
  but this is not true for `OnLines'.
  `OnSets' does not tell what happens if the argument set is not a set,
  but runs into an error in this case.
  1. I think that the predefined action functions should behave the same
     with respect to tests of the conditions on their arguments,
     and this should be documented consistently.
     (Currently there is a section ``Action on canonical representatives''
     *behind* the introduction of the action functions.)
  2. Aren't such tests an unnecessary overhead?

-3c `OrbitStabilizer' and `StabilizerOfExternalSet':
  What does the statement ``The stabilizer must have G as its parent.'' mean?
  The function *constructs* this stabilizer, so there is no requirement on
  the arguments, or?
  (And for `OrbitStabilizer', there is no description what the return value
  is ...)
  I have replaced the ``must'' by ``will'', as is used in the `Stabilizer'
  description.
-3c Is it really needed to call `ActionHomomorphism' with a result of
  `Action' (``for GAP 3 compatibility'')?
  In other words, is `Action' really required to store information about
  the arguments in its return value?
-3c `SparseActionHomomorphism':
  What does the sentence ``If G acts on a very large domain Omega not
  surjectively'' mean?
  Is surjective here the same as transitive?
  (Several formulations in this chapter sound strange.)
-3c `ActorOfExternalSet':
  This works only if `CanonicalRepresentativeDeterminatorOfExternalSet'
  is available, or?
-3c `IsTransitive':
  The definition does not assume that the group really acts on the domain
  given.  So for example the ``action on'' any singleton set is always
  regarded as transitive.
  Is this a meaningful definition?

-3c no documentation on near rings and semirings --where to put this?
-3c Would it be useful to add a disclaimer that there is little support for
  rings that have no additional structure?
  For (small) finite rings one can do something but infinite rings are
  handled by GAP in an acceptable way at most if they are at least algebras.
-3c what about sums and products of ideals?
-3c ideals:
  Currently we seem to have no support for the closure under the action of
  two different rings from the left and from the right.
  Is there need for such a generalization?
-3c Should fields lie in the filters `IsUniqueFactorizationRing',
  `IsEuclideanRing'?

  I think that the intention was to leave this function out from the GAP 4.4
  documentation, since the `\Declaration' statement in `doc/build/module.msk'
  was preceded with `%W '; but the manual builder seems to ignore this,
  so `doc/ref/module.tex' contains the documentation;
  I have now added it also to the 4.dev documentation.

-3bAH Is the `htmie4r5p0' archive still needed,
  i.e., do we still have to mention old versions of browsers such as
  Internet Explorer which had difficulties with rendering Unicode correctly?
-3c Should ``Mozilla'' be replaced by ``Firefox''?
-3c The former chapter ``Migrating to  GAP4'' is mentioned (but not via a

  I would like to ask whether these functions are interesting for GAP

  If they are not then one could regard this chapter as internal
  documentation of the current code, in the library files in question.
  What is the point in having a manual chapter with this contents?

  the documentation of the code.)

-3a Is the section ``External Representation'' really of interest?
  That is, where is this concept really used?
-3a Is it really necessary to distinguish `DeclareGlobalFunction' and
  `DeclareGlobalVariable'?
  (In fact the implementation looks different.)
  The code contains the following statement:
  `` Global functions of the GAP library must be distinguished from other
  global variables (see variable.g) because of the completion mechanism.''
  Is this really true?
  Can't the system decide whether a variable is a function or not?
-3a We could get rid of `DeclareSynonymAttr' by checking in `DeclareSynonym'
  whether the variable in question is actaully an attribute,
  and if yes then binding also the globals for its setter and its tester.
