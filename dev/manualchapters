% Chapter 1: About the GAP Reference Manual
% File: ./about.xml (line 10)
% Who: Thomas Breuer
% Started: July 27, 2009
% Finished: July 27, 2009
% Comments:
- ``This is one of four parts of the GAP documentation ..''
  This is no longer correct.
  (And add a link to the Tutorial in the HTML version.)
- ``This manual is divided into chapters. Each chapter is divided into
  sections and, within each section, important definitions are numbered.
  References are therefore triples.''
  Better state that the manual is divided into chapters, sections, and
  subsections; this is mentioned also in the chapter about the help system.
- ``in each of the four manuals'' --Correct this.
- Manual Conventions:
  The statements about boldface, italics, monospace font are not correct.
  (And in the old version, the examples were not shown as intended.
  Also the description of `Oper', with certain single letters at the end of
  the line, is no longer correct.  (And again, the old example was wrong.)
- Several instances of ``in the printed manual'' must be changed.
  Note that the old manual was essentially a TeX document --this defines the
  term ``printed manual''-- which was used to produce also the online help
  and an HTML version; so the PDF (or DVI) version was regarded as the most
  important format of the manual.
  The new manual should express that there is one source text which is
  processed to obtain three variants, and that each format has its strengths
  and its limitations.
  One such aspect is the way how formulas are shown.
  The formulation in the old manual is not very useful:
  I would regard the appearance of symbols as equally important as the
  appearance of subscripts and superscripts.
- Shouldn't the general information parts from the Preface of the Tutorial
  better be moved to the Reference Manual?

% Chapter 2: The Help System
% File: ./help.xml (line 12)
% Who: Thomas Breuer

% Comments:
- Invoking the Help:
  ``dvi files (produced by &TeX;)'' --or LaTeX?
- Browsing through the Sections:
  - ``?< displays the section preceding the previously shown section,
    and ?> takes you to the section following the previously shown one.''
    --This is not true for GAPDoc format manuals, here the help is subsection
    oriented, i. e., if one asks for a particular topic then the corresponding
    subsection is opened (not the beginning of the section that contains this
    subsection), and if one goes further with ?> then the help is opened at the
    following subsection.
    (This holds also if one has used the pager facilities for moving forwards
    to the end of the whole chapter, say.)
  - ``?<< takes you back to the first section of the current chapter,
    which gives an overview of the sections described in this chapter.''
    --Is this really true for all chapters?  (Would it be useful to state this
    as a rule for writing documentation?)
- The description of the commands ``?[book:]sections'' and
  ``?[book:][chapters]'' is not sufficient.
  If no book is prescribed then the table of contents of the first book is
  shown, quitting the help leads to the table of contents of the second book
  and so on.
  What is the difference between ``?sections'' and ``?chapters''?
  What is the difference between ``?IO:'', ``?IO:sections'', ``?IO:chapters''?
  For GAPDoc books there seems to be no difference,
  for other book such as the book for the `Hopf' package,
  there are a ``Table of Chapters'' and a ``Table of Sections''.
  (BTW, shouldn't it be ``Contents'' rather than ``Content'', in the text of
  this section as well as in the displayed help pages?)
- Changing the Help Viewer:
  - ``dvi: The standard output format of &TeX;. Only useful if &TeX; is
    installed on your system.'' --Is &TeX really needed for using xdvi?
  - ``HTML: ... Some books  use special  symbol fonts for  formulae and
    need an appropriate web browser for correct display.'' --Which book
    formats use symbol fonts? And in this case, is the choice of the browser
    the problem or the browser configuration (see below)?
- SetHelpViewer:
  - ``Furthermore the  terminal (window) should use a fixed  width font and
    we suggest to take one with <C>ISO-8859-1</C> (also called <C>latin1</C>)
    encoding.'' --Is this still true?
  - ``Note, that for  some books the browser must be configured to use symbol
    fonts.'' --Does this hold only for non-GAPDoc books? (Be specific!)
  - ``Formulae which use symbol fonts may be unreadable.'' --Tell in which
    formats symbol fonts may appear.
  - Why must TeX (LaTeX?) be installed in order to use xdvi?
- Pager:
  Heading ``Example'' above an <Example> element?
- Lots of material from older versions is still contained but commented out.
  It should simply be removed.

% Chapter 3: Running GAP
% File: ./run.xml (line 18)
% Who: Thomas Breuer
% Started: January 24, 2008
% Finished: September 04, 2008
% Comments:
- unified kilobytes vs. KBytes vs. Kilobytes (same for mega and giga),
  should be consistent throughout the manual
- unified `ctr-C', `ctrl-C' etc. (with various <C> and <A> markup)
  to <B>Ctrl-C</B>, should be consistent throughout the manual
- Are the following statements about the command line options `-m' and `-o'
  correct:
  ``Under UNIX the default amount of memory allocated by &GAP; is 24 MBytes.''
  ``Under UNIX the default amount is 256 MBytes.''
  (Is it reasonable at all to mention the values in the text,
  i.e., wouldn't it be better to point to those components in `GAPInfo'
  where the current values --not only the default values-- can be looked up?
  Note for example that the script for starting GAP may involve a different
  default.)
- The section title ``Advanced Features of GAP'' is not appropriate for a
  section about command line options.
  (And also index entries `features!under UNIX' for command line options
  look strange.)
- The section about the Mac mentions menus; should the menu entries be
  marked using <C> elements (as currently) or better using <B> elements?
- The section about the Mac states
  ``Presently, &GAP; for MacOS also supports Mac path names, but this may
  change in the future.'' --what is the status here?
- Is the file `.gaprc' really read *after* `lib/init.g'?
  (No, via a `READ' statement *in* `lib/init.g'!
  Note that it is crucial to consult `.gaprc' *before* packages are loaded
  during startup ...)
- If it is really still meaningful to support both GAP 3 and GAP 4 in one's
  `.gaprc' file, why is such a complicated example needed?
  Reading one of the two files depending on some distinguishing value
  would be natural, so why should one use `Exec' and `echo', and then read
  a file `/tmp/jJj'?
  (And why is the alternative restricted to UNIX systems? Very strange!)
- I would say that using a workspace should be the recommended way
  to speed up the startup of GAP.
  This chapter, however, advertises completion fles (``reduce the startup
  time of &GAP; drastically''), and the section on workspaces does not
  mention the speedup at all.
- Why ``The most tempting code to compile is probably the library''?
- cross-ref. to undocumented `READ_GAP_ROOT'.
- Does it make sense to explain `CrcFile' in Chapter ``Files and Filenames''
  but to show an example in this chapter, in a section of its own?
- Admit loading packages that have been installed newly after the GAP
  session started; in particular, admit loading packages that are not
  known in a given workspace!
  (There is a comment line about that.)

% Chapter 4: The Programming Language
% File: ./language.xml (line 12)
% Who: Thomas Breuer
% Started: January 24, 2008
% Finished: November 09, 2008
% Comments:
- Turn the various lists of special words into tables?
  Or better make them accessible as lists of GAP strings?
- What exactly is a keyword?  The statement that this is ``a reserved word''
  in section ``Symbols'' does not say anything.
  And after an explicit list of ``the'' keywords,
  another list of ``keywords because of technical reasons'' is shown,
  which is confusing.
  Also confusing is the statement:  ``The only consequence of this is that
  those identifiers cannot be re-assigned, and ...''
  However, we have also the feature that ordinary identifiers can be
  protected from overwriting, so this is not a meaningful criterion.
- In section ``Identifiers'', it is emphasized that `\*' is an identifier
  and not a keyword.
  This suggests that `*' in fact is a keyword. Is it?
- Another confusing topic:  On the one hand, it is stated that keywords
  cannot be used as identifiers, but on the other hand, the function
  `IsValidIdentifier' returns `true' for the input `"if"'.
  (If there is a finite list of keywords then having this as a list stored in
  a component of `GAPInfo' would make it possible to use it in
  `IsValidIdentifier'.  And also code for improving GAPDoc documents could
  benefit from that.)
- Once again identifiers:
  ``An identifier usually consists ...'' is not a sensible formulation for a
  definition, which one expects in the section ``Identifiers''.
  (There are several such vague formulations where precise statements would
  be desirable.)
- Several sections show syntax constructs which cannot be expressed using
  <ManSection> (and <A>) elements, for example `<A>function-var</A>()',
  `<A>left-expr</A> = <A>right-expr</A>', `<A>procedure-var</A>();'.
  How to deal with this?
  (Moreover, there are some cases where the ``declaration line'' does not
  fit onto one line.)
- Section ``Comparisons'' says:
  ``Note that any two objects can be compared, i.e., <C>=</C> and <C>&lt;></C>
  will never signal an error.''
  -- This is not true, of course one can get ``no method found'' errors!
- Section ``Arithmetic Operators'' claims:
  ``The meanings (semantics) of those operators generally depend on the types
  of the operands involved, and, except for <K>mod</K>, they are defined in
  the various chapters describing the types.'' --Why not for `mod'?
- Section ``For'' contained a piece of pseudo code, distinguishing
  keywords and constants from variable names.
  How to write this in GAPDoc?
- What is the `continue' statement good for?
  (At least the example shown is not striking.)
- Is the comparison with PASCAL up-to-date?
- Section ``The Syntax in BNF'' says:
  ``A few recent additions to the syntax may be missing from this definition.''
  What is a definition good for that is by definition not correct?
  And the table in this section is too long; the lower part is not visible,
  and one gets a lot of LaTeX error messages when processing the manual.
  Is this section really useful?  For the moment, I have commented it out.

- removal of prompts from the beginning of input lines:
  It is stated that this amits cut & paste of manual examples;
  is this true if manual examples are indented in the online help
  (as is currently the case)?
  (What is to do in order to admit cut & paste?)
- read-eval-print or read-eval-view?
- We provide `ViewObj', `PrintObj', `Display', `String';
  where do we state which of these operations may delegate to others?
  (There is also the undocumented function `DisplayString'.)
- The variables `last', `last2', `last3' are documented in the Tutorial,
  there is an index entry for `last' in the section ``Main Loop''
  but nothing els in the Reference Manual about `last', `last2', `last3'.
  These variables should get a proper documentation in the Reference Manual.
- Also `time' is mentioned in this section, without cross-ref.;
  Subsection ``Runtime'' in Chapter ``Debugging and Profiling'' contains
  an index entry for `time'.
- Section ``View and Print'' ends with a paragraph on `SetName'.
  But this function is documented in Chapter ``Objects and Elements''.
- Can someone explain why ``DownEnv moves *up* nr steps''?
  (The statements about this are confusing and do not fit into a Reference
  Manual.)
- Section ``Editor Support'':  Why is the following statement commented out?
  ``Send comments  and suggestions to Frank.Luebeck@Math.RWTH-Aachen.De''
  (Better suggest to contact support@gap-system.org also for these issues?)
- Is the command line history really limited to about 8000 characters?
- Shouldn't the global variable `EDITOR' be turned into a component of
  `GAPInfo'?
  (Document the default for `EDITOR'?
  Does it make sense to suggest `/usr/ucb/vi'?)

% Chapter 8: Options Stack
% File: ./options.xml (line 11)
% Who: Thomas Breuer
% Started: July 23, 2009
% Finished: July 23, 2009
% Comments:
- ``At some time, an options predicate or something of the kind may be added
  to method selection.''
  Is this still intended?
  Explain that (currently) options are ignored by the method selection;
  only arguments of the function call are evaluated by the method selection.
- ``An alternative to this system is the use of additional optional arguments
  in procedure calls. This is not felt to be adequate because many procedure
  calls might cause, for example, a coset enumeration and each would need to
  make provision for the possibility of extra arguments. In this system the
  options are pushed when the user-level procedure is called, and remain in
  effect (unless altered) for all procedures called by it.''

  This is misleading: Additional optional arguments ARE used in most places,
  and in fact they are a clean way to transfer parameters to subroutines,
  whereas global options are in danger to be overwritten by someone else
  who tries to use the same mechanism.
  (I think optional arguments should be preferred to global options whenever
  one designs new code.)
  In my eyes, global options are a convenience not for the user but only for
  the programmer, in the situation that (s)he wants to carry a new parameter
  from a top level function to a low level function (a new method, say)
  without changing the intermediate function calls.
  The best reason for using global options in such a situation is that one
  simply cannot change the existing GAP library code that does not know about
  the new parameter.
- PopOptions:
  Add ``if there is one''?
- ResetOptionsStack:
  This subsection seems to explain the undocumented function `OnQuit'
  rather than `ResetOptionsStack'.
  (And should ``elect'' in the first sentence perhaps read ``select''?)
- ValueOption:
  ``is the main method'' -- misleading term.
  ``If <opt> has never been set'' -- shouldn't this read ``if <opt> is
  currently not set''?

(I admit that I do not like global options at all, in particular the
extended function call syntax.
In my eyes, this mechanism works only because it is used rarely.
If it will become more popular then eventually it will break its own
functionality.)

3) How to display options in Arg? (see e.g. in FactorsInt, where we obtain
FactorsInt(n[, :RhoTrials:=trials]), so the comma may be confusing).
4) There are ManSections combining several defintions. I added labels where
applicable to avoid multiply defined labels, and it was enough for that

14.6.3 "State" unites definitions of "State", "Reset" and "Init".

% Comments:
- `IsInternalRep' is mentioned but not documented.
- In the section ``List Elements'', the notation `list[ pos ]' is
  introduced, which cannot be used in `ManSection';
  how to write this down?.
  Similar questions arise with `list{ poss }', `list[ pos ] := object',
  or `list1 = list2', `list1 <> list2', `list1 < list2', `list1 <= list2'.
- The `ManSections' about `IsBound' and `Unbind' for lists show the argument
  `list[n]', which can be interpreted as a contradiction to the syntax for
  optional arguments.
  (GAPDoc turns this into list[, n] --viewed as optional argument!)
  (The optimal solution would be to introduce, recommend, and document
  a two-argument syntax for these operations.)
- The documented function COPY_LIST_ENTRIES should not be written with
  capital letters only.
  (And the declaration line is too long, and looks ugly.)
- very long lines in examples in ``Comparisons of Lists''
- There is a section title ``Comparisons of Lists'' and an index entry
  ``comparisons!of lists'' (i.e., ``of lists'' is a subkey);
  the idea behind the index entry is that several subkeys will appear
  under the index entry ``comparisons''.
  A side-effect is that the online help finds two matches, one for the
  section and one for the index entry, which point to the same place.
  How to deal with this?
- It is confusing to use `last' as the name of an argument, but this
  occurred in some functions for ranges;
  which better name could be used?
  Also, should we better generally forbid assigning to `last', `last2' etc.?
  (Also `rec' should not be used as the name of an argument in the
  documentation; GAP does not admit `rec' as an argument name.)
  And should `last', `rec', and other dangerous names be forbidden in
  <A> elements?
- If ranges will be generalized in GAP 4.5,
  the restrictions on bounds and length of ranges have to be dropped.
- `PositionSorted':  The old documentation contained the statement
  ``we catch plain lists by a function to avoid method selection'',
  which I think was not intended for the manual and therefore was removed.
- `PositionSortedOp' is mentioned but not documented.
- GAPDoc problem:  Entering `?List' now opens the entry for GAPDoc's <List>
  element (the only exact match since the function `List' now has two
  variants with labels)
  [This is also a problem for `IsDocumentedFunction'.]
- `ListX' documentation:
  how to write down formatted/indented pseudo code, with comments
  in ordinary text, with <M> and <A> elements etc.
- `lists.xml' contains a section ``More about Sets'' from the GAP 3.4 manual
  that was commented out already in the 4.4 manual.
  What to do with this text?
- The sentence ``Currently &GAP; uses shellsort.'' in section
  ``Sorting Lists'' looks strange.
  (In which *methods* is shellsort used?)
- cross-references to undocumented functions `UnionSet', `IntersectionSet'
- why is IsRange a category not a property?
  (clean up IsRange vs. ConvertToRangeRep?)
- ``cross-references'' to undocumented variables `IsGF2VectorRep',
  `Is8BitVectorRep', `IsGF2MatrixRep', `Is8BitMatrixRep' in the docum. of
  `IsListDefault'

- Formulations of the form ``The `NiceObject' of <obj> is the image of <obj>

  Note that `NiceObject' and `NiceMonomorphism' are GAP functions, which
  are not the same as the words from which they are composed.
  (One could say something like ``The value of `NiceObject' for <obj> is the
  image of <obj> under the mapping returned by `NiceMonomorphism' when this
  is called with <obj>.'')
  How to proceed in such cases?
  They occur also in other chapters.
- Section ``Efficiency of Homomorphisms'' mentions a GAP function
  `GroupGeneralMappingByFunctions' which does not exist.
  (I have commented out the relevant part.
  Does anybody know what was intended here?)
- Cross-reference to undocumented function `SetIsMapping'.
- `AutomorphismGroup':
  If the definition really intends to describe the general concept of an
  automorphism group of a GAP object, in the sense of the group of all
  bijections that preserve the algebraic structure of this object,
  then this must be described.
  However, since it is not obvious what is ``the structure'' of a domain,
  I think this is asking for trouble, and so we should better describe the
  operation only in the case that ist argument is a group.
- cross-ref. to undocumented function `MappingGeneratorsImages'
  (well, in fact there was a typo, a reference to `MappingGeneratorImages)
- cross-ref. to ``Stabilizer Chains for Automorphisms Acting on Enumerators''

% Chapter 39: Group Actions
% File: ./grpoper.xml (line 12)
% Who: Thomas Breuer
% Started: December 01, 2008

% Comments:
- strange sentence in ``About Group Actions'':
  ``the call to <C>ExampleActionFunction</C> implements the induced action
  of <A>G</A>'';
  I think this is nonsense, and have commented is out.
  (For example, there is no GAP function `ExampleActionFunction'.)
- `OnLines' and other action functions promise an error when the argument
  point is not normalized,
  but this is not true for `OnLines'.
  `OnSets' does not tell what happens if the argument set is not a set,
  but runs into an error in this case.
  1. I think that the predefined action functions should behave the same
     with respect to tests of the conditions on their arguments,
     and this should be documented consistently.
     (Currently there is a section ``Action on canonical representatives''
     *behind* the introduction of the action functions.)
  2. Aren't such tests an unnecessary overhead?
     (If we really want to have foolproof behaviour here, we could introcude
     `NC' variants, and change all the occurrences in the library ...)
- `Orbit':
  The action function is optional.
  (The whole chapter should be checked for consistency.)
- `OrbitStabilizer' and `StabilizerOfExternalSet':
  What does the statement ``The stabilizer must have G as its parent.'' mean?
  The function *constructs* this stabilizer, so there is no requirement on
  the arguments, or?
  (And for `OrbitStabilizer', there is no description what the return value
  is ...)
  I have replaced the ``must'' by ``will'', as is used in the `Stabilizer'
  description.
- GAPDoc issue:
  When a declaration line is too long, such as the first one for
  `ActionHomomorphism', then it is not left aligned in the PDF version.
  Can this be fixed easily?
- Is it really needed to call `ActionHomomorphism' with a result of
  `Action' (``for GAP 3 compatibility'')?
  In other words, is `Action' really required to store information about
  the arguments in its return value?
- `SparseActionHomomorphism':
  What does the sentence ``If G acts on a very large domain Omega not
  surjectively'' mean?
  Is surjective here the same as transitive?
  (Several formulations in this chapter sound strange.)
- `ActorOfExternalSet':
  This works only if `CanonicalRepresentativeDeterminatorOfExternalSet'
  is available, or?
- `IsTransitive':
  The definition does not assume that the group really acts on the domain
  given.  So for example the ``action on'' any singleton set is always
  regarded as transitive.
  Is this a meaningful definition?

  ``the maximal degree of any permutation in &GAP; is
  <M>m = 2^{22}-1024 = 4{,}193{,}280</M>''.
- confusing statement about the space requirement:
  ``The images are either all stored as <M>16</M>-bit integers or all as
  <M>32</M>-bit integers (actually as &GAP; immediate integers less than
  <M>2^{28}</M>), depending on whether <M>d \leq 65536</M> or not.
  This means that the identity permutation <C>()</C> takes <M>4m</M> bytes
  if it was calculated as
  <M>(1, 2, \ldots, m) * (1, 2, \ldots, m)^{{-1}}</M>.''
  If the images can be 16 bit or 32 bit integers, the total space must
  depend on whether the degree m is small or not, or am I missing something?

- There is the statement: ``There are no methods yet for IsSymmetricGroup
  and IsAlternatingGroup!'' Really?
- `IsSymmetricGroup': ``... isomorphic to a natural symmetric group.''?
  (I have changed this to ``... isomorphic to a symmetric group.'')
- Is the reference <Cite Key="eickhulpkeXX"/> (up to now commented out)
  meanwhile available?
- Statement about stabilizer chain records:
  ``This gives a recursive structure where the <Q>outermost</Q> record
  representing the <Q>topmost</Q> stabilizer is bound to the group record
  component <C>stabChain</C> and has the components explained below.''
  The term ``group record component'' is wrong, it is a relic from GAP 3.
  And the term ``topmost stabilizer'' is either wrong or at least misleading,
  since the chain given by `StabChain' represents the group itself and not
  the stabilizer of the first base point.
  (In GAP 3, the situation was different: The group record itself had
  components `base' and `orbit', and the component `stabChain' represented
  the stabilizer of the first point in the `orbit' component.)
  The rest of the text should be checked for more such wrong statements.
- The list label ``limit (default Size( Parent( G ) ) or StabChainOptions(
  Parent( G ) ).limit if this is present'' is too long!
- Description of the component `orbit':
  How shall the sentence ``ordered in such a way that the base point b_i is''
  end?
- `GroupStabChain':
  cross-reference to `Generators( S )' and to ``assigned as component
  stabChain'' --relics from GAP 3?
- ``Working with large degree permutation groups'':
  Does it make sense to show a fake ``example'' of ``a group of degree
  231000'', where the input data (the generators) are not described?
  Would it be sensible to have the full example somewhere on the GAP
  web pages, and to refer to this from the Reference Manual?

    matrix groups that are  known to be solvable, and that the methods are
    especially efficient for groups whose elements are represented w.r.t. a
    pc presentation (crossref. to the chapter in question).
    Perhaps add a *VERY SHORT* remark about the different situation in GAP 3,
    for example via ``contrary to GAP 3'', but this should not be very
    prominent; in fact I would completely omit it.
  - Can the last two sentences be replaced by a reference to the package

- Section ``Elementary Operations for a Pcgs'' (and other sections):

- Induced pcgs are defined in Section 43.7, but several earlier subsections

% Comments:
- (removed ``preliminary'' from the chapter title, this chapter does not
  look worse than others)
- better discuss the various categories together in one section?
  (this would reduce the text, and make clearer what the differences are)
- no examples: either add them or explain why they are unnecessary
  (for example because interesting additive magmas in GAP have more
  structure and are explained in other chapters)
- `AsAdditiveMagma', `AsSubadditiveMagma':
  commented out, so not yet supported officially

% Started: December 01, 2008
% Finished: January 11, 2009
% Comments:
- no documentation on near rings and semirings --where to put this?
- Would it be useful to add a disclaimer that there is little support for
  rings that have no additional structure?
  For (small) finite rings one can do something but infinite rings are
  handled by GAP in an acceptable way at most if they are at least algebras.
- no definition for `DefaultRingByGenerators'
- `AsRing': commented out, so not yet supported officially
- what about sums and products of ideals?
- cross-reference to undocumented `RightActingDomain'
- empty description of `LeftActingRingOfIdeal', `RightActingRingOfIdeal'
- only few examples
- ideals:
  Currently we seem to have no support for the closure under the action of
  two different rings from the left and from the right.
  Is there need for such a generalization?
- Should fields lie in the filters `IsUniqueFactorizationRing',
  `IsEuclideanRing'?

% Chapter 55: Modules (preliminary)
% File: ./module.xml (line 11)
% Who: Thomas Breuer
% Started: February 06, 2009
% Finished: February 07, 2009
% Comments:
- removed documentation of `IsHandledByNiceBasis',
  which was already contained in `vspc.xml', in a better context
- `AsFreeLeftModule':
  I think that the intention was to leave this function out from the GAP 4.4
  documentation, since the `\Declaration' statement in `doc/build/module.msk'
  was preceded with `%W '; but the manual builder seems to ignore this,
  so `doc/ref/module.tex' contains the documentation;
  I have now added it also to the 4.dev documentation.
- Several statements talk about ``scalars''.
  It should be made precise what this means for a given module.
- The whole chapter is suitable at most for the case of (left) vector spaces,
  and all examples deal with that context.
  In fact there is few support for more general situations,
  even for Z-modules.
  GAP is almost useless for dealing with R-modules where R is a ring that
  is not a field and not Z.
  And the distinction between left modules w.r.t. scalar action and right
  modules w.r.t. an algebra action (e.g., via matrices on row vectors)
  is not described.
  All his should be sorted out.

  is in IsLexOrderedFFE, the other is in IsLogOrderedFFE?
  (Is the statement ``all elements of a given field should belong to the same
  one'' strict, and is it reasonable?)
- Why are `DegreeFFE', `IntFFE', `IntFFESymm' not declared as attributes?
- add cross-references between `IntFFE' and `IntFFESymm',

- Generalize `IntFFE' to vectors and matrices of FFEs,

% Comments:
- removed <ManSection> about `OnIndeterminates',

- Why is `Discriminant' not an attribute?
- The introductory text in section "Indeterminates" is not understandable.
- In the sections "Operations for Rational Functions",
  "Comparisons of Rational Functions", the <C>lines should be turned into
   <ManSection> structures.
- Are `NumeratorOfRationalFunction', `DenominatorOfRationalFunction' as
  independent attributes a meaningful concept,
  that is, shouldn't the information better be stored in a pair?
- `LeadingMonomial':
  ``returns the leading monomial (with respect to the ordering given by
  MonomialExtGrlexLess''
  Wouldn't it be more sensible to admit an ordering as optional second
  argument?
- In the examples, `Indeterminate' was replaced by `X'.  Why?
  (I would vote for avoiding the one-letter variable name,
  and eventually get rid of the operation name `X'.)
- Cryptic abbreviations, unnecessary or inappropriate notation,
  lots of parentheses especially in this chapter
  make it hard to understand
- `QuotRemLaurpols':
  Say what the relevant values of the argument <mode> are!
- `GcdCoeffs':
  There is the remark ``This should eventually become an operation and
  dispatch specially for rationals.''
- `UnivariatenessTestRationalFunction':
  The description is completely useless.
- `CoefficientsOfUnivariatePolynomial':
  ``It returns the empty string if pol is 0.'' --Why a string?

  is not correct, the value must be the *periodic* expansion
  0.010110011001100...
  (Without that, the subsequently introduced notion of approximation
  makes no sense.)
- It should be made precise what precision means.
- Useless definition, and no example:
  ``The valuation is the p-part of the p-adic number.''
- `IsPurePadicNumber', `IsPurePadicNumberFamily', `IsPadicExtensionNumber',
  `IsPadicExtensionNumberFamily': empty description
- The description of extensions of the p-adic number fields (Section 66.2)
  should be moved to the beginning of the chapter,
  or at least a link should be given at the beginning of the chapter;
  otherwise the introduction of the chapter suggests that only ``pure
  p-adic numbers'' are supported.

  the installation has worked.
  And the web version that can be read before the installation need not be

- Is the statement correct that there is no installer program?

- Are the required disk space and main memory mentioned up to date?
- Is the statement correct that there is no Upgrade mode?
- Is the `htmie4r5p0' archive still needed,
  i.e., do we still have to mention old versions of browsers such as
  Internet Explorer which had difficulties with rendering Unicode correctly?
- Should ``Mozilla'' be replaced by ``Firefox''?
- The former chapter ``Migrating to  GAP4'' is mentioned (but not via a
  cross-reference, so one had to read the text for finding it ...).
  Should this better be removed completely?

  I would like to ask whether these functions are interesting for GAP

  If they are not then one could regard this chapter as internal

  What is the point in having a manual chapter with this contents?

- Section `NewCategory' contains the following promise:
    @Eventually tools will be provided to display hierarchies of categories
    etc., which will help to choose <A>super</A> appropriately.
- cross-references to undocumented functions IsInternalRep, IsDataObjectRep,
  IsComponentObjectRep, IsPositionalObjectRep, ComputedSylowSubgroups.
  IsAttributeStoringRep, IsCollsElms
- There is a remark:
  ``Categories and representations should not be operations,
  the same for filters made by <C>NewFilter</C>!''
- Is the section ``External Representation'' really of interest?
  That is, where is this concept really used?
- Is it really necessary to distinguish `DeclareGlobalFunction' and
  `DeclareGlobalVariable'?
  (In fact the implementation looks different.)
  The code contains the following statement:
  `` Global functions of the GAP library must be distinguished from other
  global variables (see variable.g) because of the completion mechanism.''
  Is this really true?
  Can't the system decide whether a variable is a function or not?
- The function `CollectionsFamily' is documented lso in the Reference
  Manual; we have to take out one version.
- We could get rid of `DeclareSynonymAttr' by checking in `DeclareSynonym'
  whether the variable in question is actaully an attribute,
  and if yes then binding also the globals for its setter and its tester.

% Comments:
- In ``Extending the Range of Definition ...'', explain redeclaring
  operations? (For packages, this is anyhow necessary.)
- In ``Enforcing Property Tests'', one finds ``As mentioned above''.
  This is not very useful if one does not assume that someone reads the
  whole book.  So we should try to avoid such formulations, and to give
  explicit references instead.
  (This is of course a general statement for the whole documentation.)
- Section ``Adding a new Operation'' starts with ``The next step''
  --what does this refer to?
- Section ``Components versus Attributes'' is not appropriate.
  For example, the aspect that the knowledge of attribute values can be
  used in the method selection is not mentioned.
  (And why do attributes need *two* filter bits?)
- It should be stated which of the examples shown in the chapter are
  ``ficticious'' (not part of the GAP library) and which are taken from
  the library.
  For example, there is an example which introduces a new property
  `IsMGroup', whereas the GAP library uses the similar filter
  `IsMonomial'.
- The description of categories vs. properties in ``Adding new Concepts''
  is not correct.
- Again there are cross-references to undocumented functions
  (NormalizerOp, GroupByGenerators).
- overfull box because of a long list label in the ManSection for
  `ArithmeticElementCreator' --how to deal with this?
- Finally, the two sections ``Adding new Concepts'' and
  ``Creating Own Arithmetic Objects'' both start with ``finally''.
