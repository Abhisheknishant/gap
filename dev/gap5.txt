This is a list of features which should eventually become part of GAP.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Weak pointers
----------------

1.1) Definition
---------------

A weak pointer is a pointer $P$ pointing to an object $O$ such that
object $O$ is *not* kept alive by $P$, that is to say, if there is no
reference to object $O$ by an ordinary pointer than $O$ can be
collected.  In this case the pointer $P$ has to updated in such a way
that it no longer points to object $O$.

1.2) Possible Implementation
----------------------------

The following subsections describe possible implementations of weak
pointers in GAP 4.  The interface could be implement as

'w := WeakPointerObject()'

create a weak pointer object.

'w[1] := <obj>'

weak pointer to <obj>.

'w[1]'

return <obj>.

'IsBound(w[1])'

check if <obj> is still alive.

1.2.1) List of weak pointers
----------------------------

Assuming that there are not too many weak pointers it is possible to
keep a global list $L$ of them.  The garbage collection has to proceed as
follows:

a) mark all objects alive which can be reached from the global bags
   but ignore all references from weak pointer objects and from $L$.

b) run through the list $L$ of weak pointer.  If the weak pointer is
   garbage, remove it from the list.  If the object pointed to by
   the weak pointer if garbage, unbind it from the weak pointer.

c) collect the garbage.

Care has to be taken that weak pointers are allocated in clusters,
otherwise the swapper will run amok.


1.2.2) Weak pointers for component objects
------------------------------------------

Assuming that there are quite a lot of weak pointers one could
restrict weak pointer to only point to component objects forcing an
extra slot 'POINTED_TO_BY' to point back to the weak pointer.  In case
that more than one weak pointer is allowed for an object the weak
pointers must be some sort of linked list.  The garbage collection has
to proceed as follows:

a) mark all objects alive which can be reached from the global bags
   but ignore all references from weak pointer objects.

b) run through the list of garbage and check of the component objects
   occuring have a 'POINTED_TO_BY'.  In this case update the weak
   pointer.

c) collect the garbage.

The slot 'POINTED_TO_BY' should be the first one in an component object
in order to avoid searching for the component.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Finalise methods
-------------------

2.1) Definition
---------------

When an object <obj> is collected as garbage it should be possible to
call a method 'Finalise' which will clean up anything associated with
this object outside the control of GASMAN, for example, files,
directories, streams belonging to this object.

2.2) Problems
-------------

There are various problems with finalise methods:

- because the finalise occurs inside the garbage collections calling 
  any methods must be postponed until the heap is in a clean state again
  and objects with a finalise method (and their subobjects!) must not 
  thrown away (see below) until this method has been called.

- 'NewBag' must be reentrant

- The finalise methods might again cause a garbage collection, special
  care has to be taken so that this does not cause any problems

- Thinking of the example above the objects involving finalise methods
  might be ordered in a tree structure , these trees must be cleared
  top-down (example: files point to directories, therefore the files
  must be finalised before finalising the directories).  If there is
  a cycle you lose!

- Functions can be called without a (obvious) reason, for example, 
  "(1,2)^2" triggers a garbage collection which will cause various objects
  to finalise.  This is a philosophical problem not a technical one.


2.3) Possible Implementation
----------------------------

This implementation assumes that objects with finalise methods are not
inside a deep tree structure (where all the nodes must be finalised).  It
will not collect all garbage immediately but instead postpone some so
that it can finalise trees top-down.

A list of objects which can be finalised is stored as linked list in
'ToBeFinalised'.

Lets assume the a garbage collections starts which is not inside a
garbage collection.  In this case 'ToBeFinalised' is zero.

a) Set 'ToBeFinalised' to something non-zero.

b) run through the heap and mark all objects alive which can be reached
   from global pointers

c) run through the heap and look for soon-to-be-dead objects with a 
   finalise method, mark all *subobjects* as alive

d) run through the heap and look for soon-to-be-dead objects with a 
   finalise method, put them on the linked list 'ToBeFinalised' and
   mark them as alive

e) collect the garbage, if there is no room gained by this step we might
   be in *deep* trouble, try to get more space from the OS.

f) restore the heap to a sane state, note that it *might* be possible
   to use the link fields to implement the linked list 'ToBeFinalised'.

g) now loop over the linked list 'ToBeFinalised', take the first
   element on this list and *do not* remove it right now (see below
   in case of a nested garbage collection).  Call the finalise method
   for this object - this might cause a nested garbage collection!

h) after the finalise method is finished remove the object from the
   'ToBeFinalised' list, and free its memory

i) repeat g)

Lets assume that a nested garbage collection is going on.  In this
case 'ToBeFinalised' is *not* zero.

a) run through the heap and mark all objects alive which can be reached
   from global pointers *including* the list 'ToBeFinalised'

b) run through the heap and look for soon-to-be-dead objects with a 
   finalise method, mark all *subobjects* as alive

c) run through the heap and look for objects with a finalise method,
   add them on the linked list 'ToBeFinalised' and mark them as alive

d) collect the garbage, if there is no room gain by this step we might
   be in *deep* trouble

e) restore the heap to a sane state, note that it *might* be possible
   to use the link fields to implement the linked list 'ToBeFinalised'.

h) *do not* loop over the linked list 'ToBeFinalised' in order
   to avoid finalising an object twice.

i) return to the called NewBag, then the finalising method which called 
   the NewBag, and eventually to the top garbage collection.  This will 
   deal with the new objects on 'ToBeFinalised'.
