-1 ``This is one of four parts of the GAP documentation ..''
  This is no longer correct.
  (And add a link to the Tutorial in the HTML version.)
-1 ``This manual is divided into chapters. Each chapter is divided into
  sections and, within each section, important definitions are numbered.
  References are therefore triples.''
  Better state that the manual is divided into chapters, sections, and
  subsections; this is mentioned also in the chapter about the help system.
-1 ``in each of the four manuals'' --Correct this.
-1 Manual Conventions:
  The statements about boldface, italics, monospace font are not correct.
  (And in the old version, the examples were not shown as intended.
  Also the description of `Oper', with certain single letters at the end of
  the line, is no longer correct.  (And again, the old example was wrong.)
  adjust to the current situation!
-1 Shouldn't the general information parts from the Preface of the Tutorial
  better be moved to the Reference Manual? (yes)

% Chapter 3: Running GAP

% Comments:
-1*TB Is the file `.gaprc' really read *after* `lib/init.g'?
  We have to change and document the setup.
-1TB If it is really still meaningful to support both GAP 3 and GAP 4 in one's
  `.gaprc' file, why is such a complicated example needed?
  Reading one of the two files depending on some distinguishing value
  would be natural, so why should one use `Exec' and `echo', and then read
  a file `/tmp/jJj'?
  (And why is the alternative restricted to UNIX systems? Very strange!)
-1 Why ``The most tempting code to compile is probably the library''?
  change descr. of GAC: used only for compiling kernel modules from C code in
  packages; put this into a chapter on developing packages
-1TB Admit loading packages that have been installed newly after the GAP
  session started; in particular, admit loading packages that are not
  known in a given workspace!
  (There is a comment line about that.)

% Comments:
-1 Another confusing topic:  On the one hand, it is stated that keywords
  cannot be used as identifiers, but on the other hand, the function
  `IsValidIdentifier' returns `true' for the input `"if"'.
  (If there is a finite list of keywords then having this as a list stored in
  a component of `GAPInfo' would make it possible to use it in
  `IsValidIdentifier'.  And also code for improving GAPDoc documents could
  benefit from that.)

% Chapter 40: Permutations
% File: ./permutat.xml (line 12)
% Who: Thomas Breuer
% Started: January 24, 2008
% Finished: October 08, 2008
% Comments:
-1 contradictory statements about the maximal permutation degree:
  ``The points on which permutations in &GAP; act are the positive integers
  less than <M>2^{28}-1</M>'' vs.
  ``the maximal degree of any permutation in &GAP; is
  <M>m = 2^{22}-1024 = 4{,}193{,}280</M>''.
-1 confusing statement about the space requirement:
  ``The images are either all stored as <M>16</M>-bit integers or all as
  <M>32</M>-bit integers (actually as &GAP; immediate integers less than
  <M>2^{28}</M>), depending on whether <M>d \leq 65536</M> or not.
  This means that the identity permutation <C>()</C> takes <M>4m</M> bytes
  if it was calculated as
  <M>(1, 2, \ldots, m) * (1, 2, \ldots, m)^{{-1}}</M>.''
  If the images can be 16 bit or 32 bit integers, the total space must
  depend on whether the degree m is small or not, or am I missing something?

% Chapter 41: Permutation Groups
% File: ./grpperm.xml (line 13)
% Who: Thomas Breuer
% Started: December 01, 2008
% Finished: January 10, 2009
% Comments:
-1* Statement about stabilizer chain records:
  ``This gives a recursive structure where the <Q>outermost</Q> record
  representing the <Q>topmost</Q> stabilizer is bound to the group record
  component <C>stabChain</C> and has the components explained below.''
  The term ``group record component'' is wrong, it is a relic from GAP 3.
  And the term ``topmost stabilizer'' is either wrong or at least misleading,
  since the chain given by `StabChain' represents the group itself and not
  the stabilizer of the first base point.
  (In GAP 3, the situation was different: The group record itself had
  components `base' and `orbit', and the component `stabChain' represented
  the stabilizer of the first point in the `orbit' component.)
  The rest of the text should be checked for more such wrong statements.
-1 `GroupStabChain':
  cross-reference to `Generators( S )' and to ``assigned as component
  stabChain'' --relics from GAP 3?

% Comments:
-1 Already the trivial example to express 4/5 as a 2-adic number
  is not correct, the value must be the *periodic* expansion
  0.010110011001100...
  (Without that, the subsequently introduced notion of approximation
  makes no sense.)
