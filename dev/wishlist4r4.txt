                  Wishlist for GAP 4.4

      $Id$
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Clean up the documentation and install methods for Smith normal forms 
  of integer matrices and related topics (Install methods which essentially
  call 'NormalFormIntMat' with appropriate arguments.) See mail by Franz
  Gaehler to gap-dev from Tue, 25 Jun 2002 11:29:37 +0200 (CEST)
  (Who will do this, wasn't there someone in St.Andrews responsible for this
  code?)  (FL)
  
- Enhance the commands like 'SymplecticGroup' by introducing an optional
  argument that specifies a symplectic/orthogonal form. Add utilities for 
  transforming the groups with respect to different form into each other.
  (Proposed by Christoph Köhler, will try to urge him to implement this.)
      (FL)

- Improve the performance of the integer arithmetic, e.g. by using GMP.
      (SK)

- Extend the help functions by fuzzy search facilities,
  such that for example `?ChracterTable' finds something reasonable.
  It is not necessary to implement this from scratch in GAP,
  and it should be applicable to arbitrary texts (i.e. not be hidden inside
  the help functions).  (TB)

- Document 'RemoveCharacters', 'TranslateString' (if they turned out
  useful). Throw away IS_SUBSTRING and STRING_LOWER (or at least move to
  'obsolete.g').  I will do before the release. (FL)
