\Section{PcgsFromPcSequence}

'PcgsFromPcSequence( <group>, <gens> )'

returns  an object describing a   polycyclic generating system <pcgs> for
<group> given by the pc sequence <gens>.  It is checked  that <gens> is a
pc sequence and that it generates <group>.

'PcgsFromPcSequenceNC( <group>, <gens> )'

works like  'Pcgs' but assumes  that <gens>  is a  polycyclic  generating
sequence and that it generates <group> without checking this.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Section{Ipcgs}

'Ipcgs( <pcgs>, <gens> )'

returns an object describing an induced generating system <ipcgs> for the
group generated by <gens>.  It is checked that the elements of <gens> are
elements of the group of <pcgs>.

'IpcgsNC( <pcgs>, <gens> )'

works like 'Ipcgs' but assumes that the elements  <gens> lie in the group
of <pcgs>.

returns an object describing an induced generating system <ipcgs> with pc
sequence <gens>.  It is checked that the elements  of <gens> are elements
of the group of <pcgs> and that <gens> form an induced pc sequence.

'IpcgsFromPcSequenceNC( <pcgs>, <gens> )'

works like 'IpcgsFromPcSequence' but assumes that <gens> lie in the group
of <pcgs> and that it is an induced pc sequence.
