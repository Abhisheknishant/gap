=============================================================================
               Steps of the update of GAP-package-websites for 
                       the maintainer of the websites 
=============================================================================


1) Setup 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The maintainer needs a working copy of the WWW2 directory 
and Mixer directory in the St Andrews CVS repository. 
For detailed instructions on this see yin:/gap/WWW/INSTALL.


2) The update itself
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

a) Preliminary work of the package admin (for more details see 
   yin:/space/PackageAdmin/PackageAdmin/HOWTO): 

   The package admin checks whether there are new version of Gap packages
   and tests the new versions.

   Once all problems with the new versions
   are solved, he copies the new package archive and the new merged
   package archive to the Ftp server (currently this is 
   yin:/ftp/pub/gap/gap44).

   He also updates its 
   own copy of the online documentation of the new packages
   (which is in the moment in yin:/space/PackageAdmin/webftp/Packages/pkg).
  
   Further he prepares the update of the information of the Gap website. 
   In particular he checks in via cvs the new meta files 
   for the packages which are  

   WWW2/Packages/<pkgname>.mixer files 
   WWW2/Packages/pkgconf.py 
   WWW2/Packages/currentPackageInfoURLList file

   Then the package admin contacts the maintainer to publish 
   the changes.

b) The maintainer goes to its own WWW2/Packages directory
   (cd WWW2/Packages) and updates it (cvs update).

   Then he runs the mixer with the command 
                <mixerdir>/Mixer/mixer.py -f
   If the directory Mixer and WWW2 are in the same directory then 
                 ../Mixer/mixer.py -f 
   will work.

c) The maintainer double checks the new websites of the changed packages
   (did the version numbers changed, did the release date change,
    is the status correct, do the links to the home pages of the authors work,
    are the links to online documentation correct).

   If everything is fine, then he tags all new meta files as "PUB".
   For this he uses the command 
                       cvs tag -F PUB


d) The maintainer updates the web pages on the server with the command 

   ssh -x -i $HOME/.ssh/gap_yin_rsa gap@yin.dcs.st-and.ac.uk \
                                                   /gap/WWW/makeupdate

e) The maintainer updates the online documentation of the new packages.
   For this he uses the command 
   ssh -x -i $HOME/.ssh/gap_yin_rsa gap@yin.dcs.st-and.ac.uk \
                                                /gap/WWW/fetchpkgmanuals

   This step synchronises the contents of 
   yin:/space/PackageAdmin/webftp/Packages/pkg, which is copy of the 
   package online documentation of the package admin and 
   /gap/WWW/Manuals/pkg, which is the official place of the 
   online documentation.


Done :-)
