Dear tutorial writers!

Frank, Thomas and I have agreed on manuscript formatting rules for the
GAP-4  manual. They  should  be  tried  out  on  the  GAP-4  tutorial.
Therefore  I have committed  the  `doc' subdirectory which contains  a
file `gapmacro.tex'   and    a shell   script  `manualindex'   and   a
subdirectory `tut' which  contains three TeX  source files and an .mst
style file for `makeindex'. If there is interest,  I could also commit
the dvi file, so that you can get an impression of the whole thing.

The manual is typeset with plain TeX.

If you want to generate  the bibliography (the bbl-file) yourself, you
must also have  BibTeX. At the moment,  however,  the BibTeX databases
(the bib-files) are  taken from our local system  and are not referred
to in `gapmacro.tex'.  Something has to be done  about this, but it is
not urgent. There are no references in the tutorial up to now.

If  you want to  generate the index  (the ind-file) yourself, you must
call `../manualindex tutorial' from within the `doc/tut' subdirectory.
`manualindex' needs awk and makeindex.

The file `gapmacro.tex', which is read by `tutorial.tex', contains the
following macros definitions:

  - `text'   sets the text in typewriter style
  - ``text'' encloses the text in doublequotes (it does *not* set `text'
             in typewriter style)
  - <text>   sets the text in italics. This can also be used inside
             $...$ and `...'. Use \< to get a less than sign.
  - *text*   sets the text in emphasized style (i.e. slanted)
  - $a.b$    inside math mode, you can use . instead of \cdot. Use \. for
             a full stop in $$...$$
  - \cite{.} produces a reference to a bibliography entry (the
             \cite[.]{.} option of LaTeX is not supported)
  - "ref"    produces a reference to a label (like in the GAP-3 manual)
  - \label   defines a label
  - \index   defines an index entry. Index entries are also used for
             the section index `tutorial.six' used by the on-line help.

  \beginitems
    item & text

    item & text ...
  \enditems  produces itemized texts with hanging indentation (note
             the blank lines after each item)

  \begintt
    verbatim material
  \endtt     prints verbatim material (example sessions). Comments are
             typeset in roman font.

  \beginexamplett ... \endtt
             does the same thing, but should be used for examples to
             aid the manual checker

  \Chapter{title}\par \Section{title}\par
      make chapter or section title. Automatically generates table of
      contents, a label and an index entry. \Section{...}\null
      inhibits labels and indexing.
  \FrontMatter, \Chapters, \Appendices  parts of the book
  \Bibliography, \TableOfContents       make these chapters automatically
  \Index                                make index without chapter head

  \>function( arguments )!{ index subentry }
  \>`a binop b'{binary operation}!{ index subentry }
      make a  heading for a subsection   explaining a function  or a binary
      operation. This automatically generates   a label and an  index entry
      (with optional subentry).
  \){\fmark ...}
      the same without label and index entry. \fmark is the triangle.

  These last three probably won't occur in the tutorial.

The file `gapmacro.tex' also contains  a double column output  routine
taken from Appendix  E of the TeXbook.  This routine sometimes behaves
strangely, for example,  it eats the whole  index page (including  the
chapter head)  if the index has  no entries. (It also  sends TeX to an
output  routine deadlock if there are  too many sections in a chapter,
like in the GAP-3 manual. Don't worry about this at the moment.)

If you want  to write chapters  for the tutorial, the example chapters
committed so far should show you how to use these macros. If something
isn't clear, do not hesitate to ask me.
