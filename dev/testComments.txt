St. Andrews 21.12.05

We tested the manual examples with the test scripts 
in doc/test. 

The differences listed below, show up when all packages
are loaded. We decided to ignore these differences,
because either packages changed the behaviour how output is
printed (Case 1, 3) or the documentation explicitly allows
a different behavior (Case 2 ).

The documentation says, that this function does not guaranty
the same output, when it is called several times.
