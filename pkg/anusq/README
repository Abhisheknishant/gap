This is a simple conversion of the ANUSQ interface to GAP4. the files
`init.g' and `gap/sq.g' provide the same interface as it was in GAP 3.

The documentation in doc gives rudimentary installation information.

I cannot provide any help with compiling the SQ or the vector enumerator.

See README.orig for information about the original GAP3 version.
