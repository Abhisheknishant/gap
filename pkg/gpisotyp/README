Contents
--------

With this version you should have obtained this README file
and an archive file containing the package data
in the following files and directories:

        doc             the directory with the package manual
        gap             the directory with the GAP code
        banner.g        the file for showing the package banner
        init.g          the file for initializing the package
        read.g          the file for reading in the package        
        tst             the directory with some test files


Unpacking
---------

You may have got the GAP interface of the package as
a zoo archive (filename ends with .zoo)
or a compressed tar archive (filename ends with .tgz).
In each case, use the appropriate command on your system to unpack
the archive.

On UNIX systems the zoo archive may be unpacked by

    zoo x gpisotyp1r0.zoo

which will unpack the archive into a directory `gpisotyp' in the
current directory. 

On UNIX systems the compressed tar archive may be unpacked by

    tar xzf gpisotyp1r0.tgz

or, if tar on your system does not understand the option z, by

    gunzip gpisotyp1r0.tgz
    tar xf gpisotyp1r0.tar

which will in each case unpack the code into a directory `gpisotyp'
in the current directory.

If your system does not have a zoo programme, you can pick up the
C-code for unzoo from the GAP web page and compile it on your system.
For this your system needs to have a C-compiler.
unzoo can be used to unpack the zoo archive, as follows:

    unzoo -x gpisotyp1r0.zoo

unpacks the archive into a directory `gpisotyp' in the current directory.


Installation
------------

Installation of the GpIsoTyp package means unpacking the archive file
in an appropriate directory.

For the two ways of installing GAP packages in general,
see the sections "Installing GAP Packages" and
"Installing a GAP Package in your home directory"
in the GAP Reference Manual.

Once you have successfully installed the GpIsotyp package,
start GAP (possibly using the command line option -l) and type

gap> RequirePackage( "gpisotyp" );
true;
gap>

at the GAP prompt.
Then the functions of the package are available in the current session.
