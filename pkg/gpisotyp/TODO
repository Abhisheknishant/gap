TODO                       GAP 4 package 'gpisotyp'             Thomas Breuer

TODO now
========

- add Lie notation names!

- move `SizesSimpleGroupsInfo' from `genus/gap/utils.g?' here
  [and mention that it is about *nonabelian* simple groups only!]

- move `tomlib/gap/tmstdrd.tom' (currently in the GAP library itself!) here,
  and rearrange it!
  [add a comment part to each definition of a standardization,
  in which the reference to [Wil96] is stated!]

- composed names:
  StandardNameOfGroup( <name> );
  when the rules do not match then try whether parts match,
  and concatenate the images;
  for example, if <adm> -> <std> and <name> is of the form <int>.<adm>
  then accept <int>.<std> *provided* that <std> does not contain a '.'?
  Then 2.L4(2) is automatically mapped to 2.A8.

- what about LaTeX names, HTML names (not only for standard names!)?
  [categorize the rules by "LaTeX", "Lie", "Symmetric" etc.?]

- role of the package:
  if a database uses it, and understands the standard names,
  then automatically all admissible names are understood
  [if it understand *more* then the database may continue with an
  own step of matching]
  users can extend the name space globally for all databases!

- section on ``Standard names of Finite Simple Groups''
  (generalize to almost simple groups):
  groups are identified via names in databases such as character tables
  (package `ctbllib'), tables of marks (package `tomllib'), and the {\ATLAS}
  of Group Representations (package `atlasrep');
  `gpisotyp' provides a mapping from admissible names to one standard name,
  so other packages need not deal with other names than the standard name;
  it is possible to notify new admissible names for a group.
  (There are checks to make sure that no name is admissible for more than
  one group.)

- use in other applications:
  1. access:
     std:= StandardNameOfGroup( name );
     if std <> fail then
       name:= std;
     fi;
     -> then use name!
  2. availability:
     if not IsBound( StandardNameOfGroup ) then
       StandardNameOfGroup:= fail;
     fi;

- use in ctbllib:
  remove the ALN occurrences that are covered by gpisotyp
  (careful: keep them in the GAP 3.4 version)

- ``identification'' scripts: input a group and an isom. type

- function that returns an isomorphism from a given group to the group
  that is stored in a given table of marks (with the same isom. type;
  perhaps a variant that checks this?);
  the idea is that the information stored on the table of marks may be used
  (e.g., the definition of standard generators), and if nothing special is
  available then still the brute force approach can be used.
  (-> message to Alexander, in particular the function names/interface)

- idea:
  1. admiss. name -> std. name -> abstract isom. type -> identifications
  2. std. name -> Atlas name, Ctbl name, Tom identifier
