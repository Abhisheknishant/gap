Common Irrationalities extending the list in Appendix 1 of the ABC
==================================================================

This feature requires the following files.

README             this file
gap/irrats.g       GAP functions for creating the formatted HTML file
gap/dispmat.g      utilities for creating formatted tables
gap/htmlutil.g     utilities for creating HTML format
htm/irrats.htm     the introductory HTML file
                   (to be referenced in the homepage of the modular ATLAS)
htm/char<p>.htm    the data files that are created automatically
                   (one for each characteristic <p>)


In order to create the files `char<p>.htm', the following must be done.

1. Start GAP 4, read the file `irrats.g', and initialize the variables:

       filename:= "irrdata";     # contains the table for `htm/irrats.htm'
       format:= "HTML";
       dirname:= "cambridge";    # the directory containing
                                 # the Cambridge format files

2. Compute the desired irrationalities (and perhaps store this list).

       irratsinfo:= IrratNamesInCambridgeFormatFiles( dirname );;

   The value is a list of pairs `[ <name>, <p> ]'
   where <name> is the name of the atomic irrationality, such as "b23",
   and <p> is a prime for which this irrationality shall be listed.

3. Create the files `htm/char<p>.htm' and `irrdata.htm':

       CreateCommonIrrationalityFile( irratsinfo, format, filename );

4. Copy the table from `irrdata.htm' into `htm/irrats.htm',
   and remove `irrdata.htm'.
