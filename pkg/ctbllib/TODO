TODO                    GAP character table library             Thomas Breuer

TODO now
========

- add CommonIrrationalityInfo (irrats.g),
  add a corresponding database!

- add the files from the decomposition database!

- add the files from the construction process (~cjansen/modatlas)

- how to use dehist before/when packing the archive?

- extend the database functionality of AllCharacterTableNames,
  i.e., make orders, nccl (all attributes?) accessible;
  store the info somewhere?
  user dependent?

- implement etc/periphery:
  check whether for each MBT, there are decomposition matrices,
  there is a Cambridge file, ...

- store the history of all files since GAP 3 times !

- in README, doc/index.html and ~/temp/WWW/Share/ctbllib.input:
  add statement about using with GAP 3

- document ctoc stuff!

- standard tests for library tables (ordinary and Brauer)
  in a function in a file of its own;
  then the function can store its version number!

  (Brauer checks as in the Cambridge conversion!)
  (TENStest is in gap4/test ...)

- sorting of tables according to Galois conjugates!

- formula to *compute* extInfo data for simple groups!

- class parameters for 2.Sn?

- omit irredinfo from data files?

- as soon as names are dealt with via isom. types:
  ALN becomes obsolete; how is this handled for GAP 3?

- CharacterTableCentralProduct, ConstructCentralProduct

- differences ctadmin.tbl between 3.4.4 and 3.5 (I took the file from 3.5)
  (ConstructV4G, ConstructFactor, clms-handling, ...)
  (Are other 3.5-functions needed in 3.4.4?)

- also ctbldiff.dvi should be put on the web!

- in ClassPositionsOfDirectProductDecomposition: call ConvertToRangeRep!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

for the next release
====================

- evaluate the file `discussion'

- add new feature `mindeg' (put the HTML file on the Web)

- move ctblj4.xpl from tst to pkg/ctbllib/xpl
