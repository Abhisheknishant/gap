Database of Decomposition Matrices, constructed using GAP 4
===========================================================


1. Contents
-----------

The directory `pkg/ctbllib/dec' must contain the subdirectories
`gap' (containing the files `format.g', `make.gd', and `make.gi')
and `tex' (where the database files are created automatically),

and the files

`README'
    this file,

`doc/introduc.tex'
    a brief introduction ``How to Read the Decomposition Matrices'',
    the corresponding PDF file is referenced in `index.html',

`index.html'
    the base page of the database,

`decmats.css'
    the style file used by `index.html' and by all data files,

`announcement'
    the text of the email message that had been sent to the GAP Forum
    at some time, announcing the availability of this database,
 
`init.g'
    the file that should be read before one recomputes data files.


2. How to Use the Database
--------------------------

For constructing all LaTeX files, start GAP 4 in the
directory containing subdirectories `gap' and `tex',
and then call

    LogTo( "make.log" );
    Exec( "date" );
    Read( "init.g" );
    DecMatMakeAll();

The files for one group only, with name <name>, can be created by calling
`DecMatMakeGroup'.

If everything worked then the PDF files plus an `index.html'
file are stored in the directory `tex/<name>'.

For example, the files containing the $p$-modular decomposition matrices
of $A_5$, for $p \in \{ 2, 3, 5 \}$, are created with

    gap> names:= DacMatNames();;
    gap> entry:= First( names, x -> x[1][1] = "A5" );;
    gap> DecMatMakeGroup( entry );


The HTML table in the `index.html' file of the database can be constructed
with

    gap> DecMatHTMLTableString( names )

where the argument should be the list returned by `DecMatNames'.
