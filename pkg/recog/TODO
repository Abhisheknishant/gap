Do soonish:

Soonest:

 - PCGS with memory: Luks, Murray, Cooperman implementation
 - Hash functions for vectors over finite fields 257 <= q <= 65536 
   -> NumberFFVector
 - GenSS: Handle "small" cases quick
 - Quick stabchain access for small cases
 - ?At the same time use found normal subgroup to find action if possible
 - Finish derived case for only one homogeneous component (-> tensor)
 - Finish semilinear by looking for field automorphisms in derived
 - Make NaturalSL a projective method -> polish l(2,q), use bb-l(2,q)
 - Make TwoLargeElOrds a projective method, polish databases setup
 - Implement constructive classical in natural rep ->O'Brien/Leedham-Green
 - TwoElementOrds: Ignore degree bound if in defining characteristic

Sooner:
 - Get ActionHomomorphism behaviour fixed -> gap-dev
 - more Tests for tensor decomposable
 - O'Brien/Malle recognition?
 - Make two separate packages recog and recogmeth using each other
 - SGS Matrix verification

Soon:
 - Involution centralizer method
 - Pete Sp
 - Play with tensor induced
 - MinBlocks from Steve?
 - Lowindex using derived subgroup?
 - Do something if LowIndex stumbles on non-Absolute irreducible restriction
 - Find Tiep's paper with exception lists
 - Change message to something about "defining characteristic".
--> Akos: See what we can do about bad statistics for p=7 and such (bug!)
 - add Steve's Simple recognition
 - do more C9 cases by collecting hints
 - do more C9 cases
 - do more C9 cases

========================================================================

Future: 

Think whether the changing of gensN after creation might hurt other
places than LowerLeftPGroup.

Cleanup and complete the code for using blackbox and gensift

SLPforElement methods without evaluation --> like in SiftAsWord ???

Do we have something better for diagonal matrices???

make New...StraightLineProgram official, throw old stuff out
slp code into main library

improvements of library in library

 - Replace PseudoRandom with product replacer objects  --> eigenes

========================================================================

to talk ???:

  Convention: SLPforElement guarantees that a returned slp does the job
    ==> \in is easier, does not have to evaluate the slp
    ==> in StabChain code we divide up labels
    ==> in Hom code we divide up preimage of the image, go to kernel
    ==> doable everywhere (in fact done everywhere)

  FindKernelFastNormalClosure always?


========================================================================

to change once the new vector/matrix interface is in place:

  FieldOfMatrixGroup/DefaultFieldOfMatrixGroup
