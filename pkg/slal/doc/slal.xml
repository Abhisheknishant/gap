Now I put the following (the first two mainly by Willem):
<P/>
* File isola.g: a general function to determine whether two algebras are isomorphic (in the field closure), this method
uses the Groebner bases and Singular.
<P/>
* File lietabs.g: a list of all? Lie algebras up to dimension 5, of the nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 6 and the
Seeley list of the nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 7.
<P/>
* File mpgong.g: the list of nilpotent algebras by Gong, which include the dimension 7 as calculated by him, and up to
dimension 6 as reported by him in the thesis.
<P/>
* File sla.g: a naive general implementation of the functions SmallLieAlgebra, AllSmallLieAlgebras,
NumberSmallLieAlgebras, IdSmallLieAlgebra, that can use both of the above lists.
<P/>
* File mm.g: the list of nilpotent algebras up to dimension 6, from the lists of Mubarakzyanov and of Morozov, as
reported in Patera, J.; Sharp, R. T.; Winternitz, P.; Zassenhaus, H.
<P/>
The lists above include only indecomposable algebras.
<P/>
Marco
