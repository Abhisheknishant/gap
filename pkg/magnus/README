README file for ``magnus'' share package.

This will eventually be a share package supporting use by GAP of the
magnus back-end as a slave process. It also includes some utility
functions useful when GAP is being used as a Magnus package.

It's in a very fragmentary state at the moment. I'm just committing it 
to protect against losing the files.
