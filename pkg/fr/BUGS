IsFiniteState	never detects loops or patterns in the states, if not f.s.

Iterator	not coded for FullSCxxx(IsBounded,IsFiniteState,...)

PeriodicList	no method for Concatenation and Apply

IsTorsion	is not proven to give the right answer

DELAUNAY_TRIANGULATION	should be more stable in its decision to add extra points
