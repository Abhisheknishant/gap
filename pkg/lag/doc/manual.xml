  <Abstract>
   &LAGUNA; is a share package for &GAP;~4, which 
is capable of computing with group
algebras of finite <M>p</M>-groups over the field of <M>p</M> elements. 
Besides computing some general properties and attributes, 
the &LAGUNA; share package is able to carry out two main kinds 
of computations. Namely, it  is capable of computing the structure
of the normalised unit group, and it is capable of verifying whether some Lie
property holds in such  a group algebra. 
&LAGUNA; written in the &GAP;~4 computer algebra system, and it
   runs within the same system.

  <Acknowledgements>
Some of the features of &LAGUNA; were already included in the first author's
&LAG; package, which was ported to &GAP;4 by the first author
during a visit to St Andrews. He is grateful to the members of the &GAP; team,
in particular to Steve Linton, Willem de Graaf, Thomas Breuer, and Alexander
Hulpke.<P/>

The three other authors would first like to thank the first author, Richard,
for allowing them to update and extend this package. We are also grateful to.......
