1.0 - 2.0 
    Maintained by Richard Rossmanith

2.1 * Obsolete operation `BasisByGeneratorsNC' replaced by `BasisNC'
      (lib/lag.gi)
    * Version changed (init.g)
      - ideally init.g should read VERSION (so it need only be changed in
        one place), but the commented out method to do this needs to be
        verified that it works on Windows and Macintosh
    * Split off ReadPkg of .gi file into read.g
    * Tidied up README.lag
    * Added VERSION, ChangeLog
    * All other changes made were to improve the documentation
      o (non-empty) doc/manual.bib added 
      o doc/Makefile now has targets for manual.ps, manual.pdf, htm
      o Updated examples for GAP 4.3 (doc/lag.msk)
      o Markup changes so that bibliography and HTML version now possible
        (doc/{lag.msk,manual.tex},lib/lag.gd)
