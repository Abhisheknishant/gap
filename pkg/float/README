                             The Float package

This is the README file for the GAP package "Float",
version $Id: README,v 1.1 2008/04/21 18:38:07 gap Exp $

This package implements floating-point numbers, with arbitrary precision,
based on the C library MPFR.

The package is distributed in source form, and does not require anything
else than a running GAP 4.4 or later. For updates, check

     http://mad.epfl.ch/~laurent/Float/
  
To use the package, start GAP and type

LoadPackage("Float");

The "Float" package banner should appear on the screen.

For details on how to use the Float package, please consult the documentation.
It should be compiled, after the command `LoadPackage("Float")', by invoking

FLOAT_MAKEDOC();

The documentation will then be available in the `doc' subdirectory
(view either `manual.dvi' via `xdvi' or or `manual.pdf' via a PDF
viewer).
