%%  Bibliography in the ATLAS of Brauer Characters (p. xv-xvii)
%%
%%  How did this file arise:
%%  - Take the entries from the bibliography of the ABC.
%%  - Fetch the corresponding entries in BibTeX format from MathSciNet
%%    if available, take the entry also if it looks slightly differently.
%%    (E.g., cited preprints may have appeared,
%%    the types 'inproceedings' and 'incollection' seem to be used 
%%    inconsistently,
%%    LaTeX markup was clearly used differently, 
%%    some articles in Russian are now cited with Russian titles.)
%%  - If several sources are given (this happens in the bibliography in the
%%    ATLAS of Finite Groups) then take both of them.
%%  - If no MR number is available or if the MR entry does not conform the
%%    BibTeX definitions then consult Zentralblatt MATH,
%%    and add a component 'zblnumber' if the entry is found there.
%%  - If several reprints of a book are found in MR then take all those
%%    that are not older than the one referenced in the original list.
%%  - Replace the label (MR number) by a combination of authors' names
%%    and year.
%%  - If applicable then add a 'collection' or 'proceedings' entry,
%%    and add a 'crossref' component.
%%  - If the printed MR data are available and contain a language information
%%    that is not available in the BibTeX version from MathSciNet then add a
%%    'note' component for this.
%%  - Add a 'sorttag' component where necessary, in particular if several
%%    publications of the same author(s) in the same year and journal are
%%    logically dependent, 
%%    for example such that errata appear after the article to be corrected
%%    or simply because of the journal pages.
%%    (This replaces the '\noopsort' comments in 'year' fields which are
%%    recommended by BibTeX.)
%%  - In case of the bibliography in the ATLAS of Finite Groups,
%%    add a 'sporsimp' component that describes the assignment to sporadic
%%    simple groups; 
%%    entries that are assigned to several groups occur several times, 
%%    once for each assignment.
%%  - In any case, write component names not coming from MathSciNet in
%%    small letters, whereas those coming from MathSciNet are always
%%    capitalized.

%%  Errors in MR data (corrected in this file)

%%  [MR0346033]
%%    no author/editor (also in the Zbl database), so omit this entry,
%%    and omit the crossref to it in [Fon74]

%%  Changes compared to the printed Atlas of Brauer characters:
%%
%%  p. xv:  - changed title of Conway/Curtis/Norton/Parker/Wilson (1985)
%%            from ``An Atlas of Finite Groups'' to ``Atlas of finite
%%            groups'';
%%          - pages in Gilkey/Seitz (1988) are ``407-416'' not ``405-416''.
%%          - changed address in Goldschmidt (1980) from ``Berkeley'' to
%%            ``Wilmington, Del.''.
%%  p. xvi: - preprint Hiss/M"uller (1993) appeared in Comm. Algebra 23
%%            (1995), p. 4633-4667;
%%          - article Hiss/Lux/M"uller (in Press) appeared 1995 in vol. 19,
%%            no. 6, pp. 585--600; the title is different:
%%            ``The $2$-modular decomposition matrices of the non-principal
%%            blocks of maximal defect of the triple cover of the sporadic
%%            simple McLaughlin group''
%%          - title of Hiss/Jansen/Lux/Parker (in Press) is ``Computational
%%            Modular Character Theory'' not ``Computing with Modular
%%            Characters'';
%%          - journal in Humphreys (1982) is ``Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh
%%            Sect. A'' not ``Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh, Series A'';
%%          - preprint Jansen/Wilson (1994a) appeared in J. London Math.
%%            Soc. (2) 56 (1997), p. 579--583;
%%          - preprint Jansen/Wilson (1994b) appeared in J. London Math.
%%            Soc. (2) 57 (1998), p. 71--90;
%%          - preprint Jansen/Wilson (1994c) appeared in Comm. Algebra 24
%%            (1996), p. 873-879;
%%          - titles of Khosraviyani (1984) and Khosraviyani/Morris (1985)
%%            are ``Decomposition numbers of exceptional Weyl groups. I''
%%            and ``Decomposition numbers of exceptional Weyl groups. II'',
%%            respectively;
%%          - in Kondrat'ev (1988a) and Kondrat'ev (1988b),
%%            cite ``Algebra i Logica'' not ``Algebra and Logic'';
%%          - journal in Martineau (1972) is ``J. London Math. Soc. (2)''
%%            not ``J. London. Math. Soc.''.
%%
%%  (Throughout the bibliography, Hi\3 was changed to Hiss.)
