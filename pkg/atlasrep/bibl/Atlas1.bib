%%  Bibliography in the ATLAS of Finite Groups (part 1)
%%
%%  How did this file arise:
%%  - Take the entries from the ATLAS bibliography on p. 243.
%%  - Fetch the corresponding entries in BibTeX format from MathSciNet
%%    if available, take the entry also if it looks slightly differently.
%%    (E.g., cited preprints may have appeared,
%%    the types 'inproceedings' and 'incollection' seem to be used 
%%    inconsistently,
%%    LaTeX markup was clearly used differently, 
%%    some articles in Russian are now cited with Russian titles.)
%%  - If several sources are given (this happens in the bibliography in the
%%    ATLAS of Finite Groups) then take both of them.
%%  - If no MR number is available or if the MR entry does not conform the
%%    BibTeX definitions then consult Zentralblatt MATH,
%%    and add a component 'zblnumber' if the entry is found there.
%%  - If several reprints of a book are found in MR then take all those
%%    that are not older than the one referenced in the original list.
%%  - Replace the label (MR number) by a combination of authors' names
%%    and year.
%%  - If applicable then add a 'collection' or 'proceedings' entry,
%%    and add a 'crossref' component.
%%  - If the printed MR data are available and contain a language information
%%    that is not available in the BibTeX version from MathSciNet then add a
%%    'note' component for this.
%%  - Add a 'sorttag' component where necessary, in particular if several
%%    publications of the same author(s) in the same year and journal are
%%    logically dependent, 
%%    for example such that errata appear after the article to be corrected
%%    or simply because of the journal pages.
%%    (This replaces the '\noopsort' comments in 'year' fields which are
%%    recommended by BibTeX.)
%%  - In any case, write component names not coming from MathSciNet in
%%    small letters, whereas those coming from MathSciNet are always
%%    capitalized.

%%  Errors in MR data (corrected in this file)
%%
%%  [Dav69]
%%    misprint in the title of MR0248203,
%%    must be ``bibliographical'' not ``biliographical'';
%%    also removed the trailing dot and whitespace
%%  [MR0349819]
%%    no author/editor; in Zbl. 0282.00024, one finds D. Gorenstein
