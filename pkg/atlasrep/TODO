TODO                       GAP 4 package 'atlasrep'             Thomas Breuer

TODO now
========

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
overview: provide subgroup/supergroup info for categorized table!

where is the class "pkg" defined?

tst/testinst.g: check the permissions! (how?)

provide MathJax in HTML pages

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

for the next release
====================

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Provide a function that does not just database access
  but derives the repres. by applying an outer autom., a Galois
  autom., or by switching to a factor group.
  see gap/charfeat.g

- MonomorphismAtlasSubgroup ??

- OneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo( ..., Character, IsIrreducible, ... ) ???

- add a check for `AtlasTableOfContents( "remote" )';
  this way, compare the current `atlasprm.g' with the file available
  on the package's homepage
  (and this tests `AtlasOfGroupRepresentationsUpdateTableOfContentsFile')

- in SLD: replace order function by order check?
  (with desired order as an argument, which can be given to `OrderMatTrial')

- ComputedMinimalRepresentationInfo:
  call in a test file?

- missing min. perm. repr. info!

- Call `AtlasClassNames' for all tables of nonsimple and almost simple
  groups in a test function?

- make standardization info explicit,
  in particular the orders of the generators (and add a check of all data)

- new test: run all SLP as BBox?

- how to test GAP readability?

- check TOM standardizations!

- add missing group order info: 557 names, 171 have no character table

- (which of the restrictions yield standard generators?)

- add a test for integral repres.:
  reduce mod a few primes, test group order!

- ReplaceAtlasTableOfContents: prints only the automatic part
  (is this documented?)

- test integral representations via reduction mod 2

- inform about superfluous htm files in the local and the public directory

- replace `atlasprm.g' only if data were added/changed
  (since `make webrefresh' will otherwise replace the file just because of
  a changed ``lastupdated'')

- mention the ``RemoteUpdates'' function also in the section
  about ``private extensions'' that warns about corrupted files!
  (problem if the local files are compressed!!)

- how many files are in the database now?
  (ATLAS v1 had 4250 files in `reps', and 456 in `words')
  (ATLAS v2 on 08.01.2002: 4645 files in `datagens', 415 files in `dataword')
  atlasrep v1.0 has 2107 times AGRTOC in its atlasprm.g,
  atlasrep v1.1 has at least 3712 times AGRTOC

- names:

AGRGNAN("M20","M20");
AGRGNAN("2aM20","2aM20");
AGRGNAN("2bM20","2bM20");
AGRGNAN("2cM20","2cM20");
AGRGNAN("4bM20","4bM20");

- quaternionic representations: 2.J2 < GL(3,H(Q(b5))), ...

- ask Max: clicking `gzipped' or `zoo' in index.html yields an error -- why?

- acknowledgements via URLs!

- check all #T entries in the gap files and %T in docum. files!

- what happens if a file transfer is interrupted?
  (How to get rid of corrupted files?
  Issue warnings if a file is incomplete?)

- ask Rob again for Tilman Schulz' data files!

- new function: isoclinic group
  (missing: info for isoclinisation! (inner/outer generators))

- new script: check for unused locals
  (also other packages)

- Web services:
  hyperlinks between group info files and the corresponding files in `ctbltoc'
  (and TOM, and gpisotyp, ...)

- if info w.r.t. <std> is required and a script for <std2> -> <std> is
  available as well as the info w.r.t. <std2>
  then announce the availability w.r.t. <std>,
  and fetch this automatically!

- when isotypes are available,
  access info about ``all maxes known''!
  (also: function `AtlasName' for isotype, string, group, ...?)

- print a warning if no standardization is entered
  and several poss. exist (if default choice is really a choice)

- ResultOfStraightLineProgram for ATLAS SLPs:
  own function that checks whether the standardizations coincide?

- AtlasNames & isom. types, also for docum. (and connect to TOM library)

- new test for automorphism scripts: check whether the gen. mapping is
  really a homomorphism (``hard test'')

- Make standardization definitions explicitly accessible in GAP.
  (crossref. to HumanReadable..., IsStandardGener...)

- When `InfoRead1' is ``cleaned'' then mention this in the documentation.

- store/replace of t.o.c. also for private t.o.c.s!

- as soon as `tomlib' gets its own documentation, change the crossreference
  of `RepresentativeTomByGeneratorsNC'.

- as soon as isomorphism types become available, change the example using
  tables of marks

- AGRTestFiles() needed about 12 minutes before the stream code was changed;
  (with a much smaller database)
  how long now??
  [test for BM-files: space/time?]

- finish the treatment of prime fields in `scanmtx.gi' as soon as the streams
  stuff is efficient again

- explicit standardization info: `DisplayStandardizationInfo' (for isom. type)
  (and compare with that in `tomlib')

- add new functionality:
  - ``total number of data'' (representations, scripts, files, ...)
  - AllAtlasSLPInfo( "cyclic" ) -- for all groups
  - admit `DisplayAtlasInfo( <inforec> )'?

- manual: - section 2.5: is the info about ``irreducible'' or ``primitive''
            available?
            [note that also the AGRRNG info is more than the filenames say]

- other (precalculated) format for the t.o.c. easier (faster) readable?

- deal with Magma format files again

Hi, Thomas,

Definitions of standard generators are at the moment
only distributed on HTML pages. I know we have talked
about GAP-readable definitions, but I don't think
we are any nearer to implementing such things.
Perhaps you have some idea of what you want? - then
maybe I can see if I can provide something like it.

Rob.
