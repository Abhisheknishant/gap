<Heading>New Objects and Utility Functions Provided by the
<Package>AtlasRep</Package> Package</Heading>

This chapter describes &GAP; objects and functions that are provided in the
<Package>AtlasRep</Package> package but that might be of general interest.

<P/>

The new objects are straight line decisions
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Straight Line Decisions"/>) and
black box programs (see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Black Box Programs"/>).

<P/>

The new functions are concerned with representations of minimal degree,
see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Representations of Minimal Degree"/>.

<Section Label="sect:Representations of Minimal Degree">
<Heading>Representations of Minimal Degree</Heading>

This section deals with minimal degrees of permutation and matrix
representations.
We do not provide an algorithm that computes these degrees for an arbitrary
group,
we only provide some tools for evaluating known databases,
mainly concerning nearly simple groups,
in order to derive the minimal degrees,
see Section&nbsp;<Ref Subsect="subsect:minimality-criteria"/>.
<P/>
In the <Package>AtlasRep</Package> package, this information is used in
<Ref Func="DisplayAtlasInfo"/>,
<Ref Func="OneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo"/>, and
<Ref Func="AllAtlasGeneratingSetInfos"/>.

<Heading>Bibliographies of Sporadic Simple Groups</Heading>

The bibliographies contained in the &ATLAS; of Finite Groups
<Cite Key="CCN85"/> and in the &ATLAS; of Brauer Characters
<Cite Key="JLPW95"/> are available online in HTML format, see
<URL>http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/atlasrep/bibl/index.html</URL>.
<P/>
The source data in BibXMLext format is part of the <Package>AtlasRep</Package>
package,
in four files with suffix <F>xml</F> in the package's <F>bibl</F> directory.
Note that each of the two books contains two bibliographies.
<P/>
Details about the BibXMLext format, including information how to
transform the data into other formats such as BibTeX,
can be found in the &GAP; package
<Package>GAPDoc</Package> (see <Cite Key="GAPDoc"/>).
<P/>
These source files are used also by the function
<Ref Func="BrowseBibliographySporadicSimple"/>.
