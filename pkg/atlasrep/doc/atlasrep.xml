<Chapter Label="chap:Introduction to the AtlasRep Package">
<Heading>Introduction to the <Package>AtlasRep</Package> Package</Heading>

The aim of the &GAP;&nbsp;4 package <Package>AtlasRep</Package> is to provide
a link between &GAP; and the <Q>&ATLAS; of Group Representations</Q>,
a database that comprises representations of many almost simple groups
and information about their maximal subgroups.
This database has been available independent of &GAP; at

<P/>
&ATLASSERVER;
<P/>

The <Package>AtlasRep</Package> package consists of this database
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:An Atlas of Group Representations"/>)
and a &GAP; interface
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:The GAP Interface to the Atlas of Group Representations"/>);
the latter is extended by further information available via the internet
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Web Services for the AtlasRep Package"/>).

<P/>

Information about installing and customizing the package can be found
in the sections&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Installing the AtlasRep Package"/>,
<Ref Sect="sect:Loading the AtlasRep Package"/>, and
<Ref Sect="sect:Maintaining the Local Data of the AtlasRep Package"/>,
<Ref Sect="sect:User Parameters for the AtlasRep Package"/>,
<Ref Sect="sect:Extending the Atlas Database"/>.

<P/>

Finally, Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:What's New in AtlasRep?"/>
lists the changes w.r.t.&nbsp;previous releases of the package,
and Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Acknowledgments"/>
acknowledges contributions of non-authors to the package.

<Section Label="sect:An Atlas of Group Representations">
<Heading>An &ATLAS; of Group Representations</Heading>

The &ATLAS; of Group Representations consists of matrices over various rings,
permutations, and shell scripts encoding so-called black box programs
<Index>black box program</Index>
(see <Cite Key="Nic06"/>
and Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Black Box Programs"/>).
Many of these scripts are straight line programs
<Index>straight line program</Index>
(see&nbsp;<Cite Key="BSW01"/>, <Cite Key="SWW00"/>,
and&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Straight Line Programs" BookName="ref"/>)
and straight line decisions
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Straight Line Decisions"/>).
These programs can be used to compute certain elements in a group <M>G</M>
from its standard generators
(see&nbsp;<Cite Key="Wil96"/>
and&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Standard Generators of Groups" BookName="ref"/>),
for example generators of maximal subgroups of <M>G</M>
or representatives of conjugacy classes of <M>G</M>.

<P/>

The &ATLAS; of Group Representations has been prepared by Robert Wilson,
Peter Walsh, Jonathan Tripp, Ibrahim Suleiman, Richard Parker,
Simon Norton, Simon Nickerson, Steve Linton, John Bray, and Rachel Abbott
(in reverse alphabetical order).

<P/>

The information was computed and composed using computer algebra systems
such as &MeatAxe; (see&nbsp;<Cite Key="Rin98"/>),
Magma (see&nbsp;<Cite Key="CP96"/>), and &GAP;
(in reverse alphabetical order).
<Index Key="MeatAxe">&MeatAxe;</Index>
<Index Key="Magma"><Package>Magma</Package></Index>
Part of the constructions have been documented in the literature on
almost simple groups, or the results have been used in such publications,
see for example the references in&nbsp;<Cite Key="CCN85"/>
and&nbsp;<Cite Key="BN95"/>.

<P/>

If you use the &ATLAS; of Group Representations to solve a problem then
please send a short email to&nbsp;&WILSONMAIL; about it.
The &ATLAS; of Group Representations database should be referenced
with the entry&nbsp;<Cite Key="AGR"/> in the bibliography of this manual.

<P/>

If your work made use of functions of the &GAP; interface
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:The GAP Interface to the Atlas of Group Representations"/>)
then you should also reference this interface,
as follows.

<Index Key="C-MeatAxe"><C>C</C>-&MeatAxe;</Index>
The &GAP; interface to the &ATLAS; of Group Representations consists of
essentially two parts.

<P/>

First, there is the <E>user interface</E>
which allows the user to get an overview of the contents of the database,
and to access the data in &GAP; format;
this is described in
Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="chap:The User Interface of the AtlasRep Package"/>.
Advanced users may add their own data to the database,
this is described in Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="chap:Private Extensions"/>.

<P/>

Second, there is <E>administrational information</E>,
which covers also the declaration of &GAP; objects
such as straight line decisions and black box programs.
This is important mainly for users interested in the actual implementation
(e.&nbsp;g., for modifying the package) or in using it together with the
<C>C</C>-&MeatAxe; standalone (see&nbsp;<Cite Key="Rin98"/>);
this is described in
Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="chap:Technicalities of the AtlasRep Package"/>.

<P/>

Information concerning the <C>C</C>-&MeatAxe;,
including the manual&nbsp;<Cite Key="Rin98"/>,
can be found at

<P/>
<URL>http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/LDFM/homes/MTX</URL>
<P/>

<!-- A &GAP;&nbsp;4 Package that provides access to the functionality of the
C-&MeatAxe; is in preparation. -->

<P/>

The &GAP; interface should be regarded as preliminary.
Hopefully it will become more user-friendly when the
&ATLAS; of Group Representations will be integrated into a larger &GAP;
database of groups and their representations, character tables, and
tables of marks.
<P/>
The interface and this manual have been provided by Thomas Breuer,
except for the interpreter for black box programs
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Black Box Programs"/>),
which is due to Simon Nickerson.
Comments, bug reports, and hints for improving the interface
can be sent to&nbsp;<Email>sam@math.rwth-aachen.de</Email>.

<Section Label="sect:Installing the AtlasRep Package">
<Heading>Installing the <Package>AtlasRep</Package> Package</Heading>

To install the package, unpack the archive file in a
directory in the <F>pkg</F> directory of your local copy of &GAP;&nbsp;4.
This might be the <F>pkg</F> directory of the &GAP;&nbsp;4 root directory,
see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Installing a GAP Package" BookName="ref"/>
for details.
It is however also possible to keep an additional <F>pkg</F> directory
in your private directories,
see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="GAP Root Directory" BookName="ref"/>.
The latter possibility <E>must</E> be chosen if you do not have write access
to the &GAP; root directory.

<P/>

Data files (in the subdirectories <F>datagens</F> and <F>dataword</F>
of the package) that are available from an earlier version
of the package are in principle kept;
see&nbsp;<Ref
Func="AtlasOfGroupRepresentationsTestTableOfContentsRemoteUpdates"/>
for necessary updates.

<P/>

If it is likely that one will work offline, it makes sense to install the
<Q>starter archive</Q> that can be downloaded from the package's homepage.

<P/>

The package consists entirely of &GAP; code,
no external binaries need to be compiled for the package itself.
However, if the &GAP; package <Package>IO</Package> <Cite Key="IO"/>
<Index>IO package</Index>
is used to access remote data files
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="subsect:Accessing data files with wget or IO"/>)
then its external binary must be available.

<P/>

After unpacking the package archive,
it should be checked whether the subdirectories
<F>datagens</F> and <F>dataword</F> of the package directory have
write permissions for those users who will download files from the servers.
The recommended permissions under UNIX are set as follows.

<P/>

<Log><![CDATA[

<Section Label="sect:Loading the AtlasRep Package">
<Heading>Loading the <Package>AtlasRep</Package> Package</Heading>

The <Package>AtlasRep</Package> package may be loaded automatically when
&GAP; is started, for example when other &GAP; packages require it,
or it has to be loaded within the &GAP; session as follows.

<Example><![CDATA[

The current <E>table of contents</E> of the database is contained in
the file <F>gap/atlasprm.g</F> of the <Package>AtlasRep</Package> package.
This file is read by default when the package is loaded.
It may happen that new data files have been added to the servers since the
last release of the <Package>AtlasRep</Package> package,
thus it is useful to update the table of contents of the package
from time to time.

<P/>

For that, one can fetch the most recent version of the file
<F>gap/atlasprm.g</F> from the home page of the package
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Web Services for the AtlasRep Package"/>),
either by calling&nbsp;<Ref Func="ReloadAtlasTableOfContents"/>
in a &GAP; session
or <Q>by hand</Q>.
In the latter case, the new file can then be read into the &GAP; session via
<Ref Func="ReplaceAtlasTableOfContents"/>.
<#Include Label="ATLASREP_TOCFILE">

<P/>

Users who have write access to the directory where the
<Package>AtlasRep</Package> package is
installed can alternatively use the <F>maketoc</F> script in the <F>etc</F>
directory of the package for regularly updating the file
<F>gap/atlasprm.g</F>.
Users without this write access can store the new file in a different place,
and read it with <Ref Func="ReplaceAtlasTableOfContents"/>.

<Index>local access</Index>

There are two possibilities to use the <Package>AtlasRep</Package> package.

<P/>

<List>
<Mark><E>Local access only (offline)</E></Mark>
<Item>
    You can restrict the access to the data that are actually stored in
    the local installation of &GAP;.
</Item>
<Mark><E>Remote access (online)</E></Mark>
<Item>
    If your computer is connected to a network that provides access to
    the &ATLAS; data (for example the internet) then the functions of the
    package may fetch the requested data automatically from remote servers
    when they are required for the first time;
    these data are then by default stored in the local copy,
    so later access to them needs no network transfer.
</Item>
</List>

<P/>

The latter possibility is presently not used by other &GAP; packages,
so it may be regarded as an important feature of the
<Package>AtlasRep</Package> package.
Anyhow it requires a few words of explanation.

<P/>

The possibility of online access reflects in particular the fact
that the &ATLAS; of Group Representations is designed
as an <E>open database</E>, it is expected to grow.
As soon as the developers of the &ATLAS; of Group Representations add
new information to the servers,
these data become available in &GAP; when remote access is enabled,
after one has updated the corresponding table of contents
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Maintaining the Local Data of the AtlasRep Package"/>).

<P/>

Remote access is enabled if and only if the value of the <C>remote</C>
component of the global variable
<Ref Var="AtlasOfGroupRepresentationsInfo"/> is <K>true</K>.
If one wants to work offline, i.e., if one does <E>not</E> want &GAP;
to attempt accessing remote data
then this value must be set to <K>false</K>.

<P/>

Conversely, if the default value of the <C>remote</C> component
in your &GAP; installation is <K>false</K>
then changing this value to <K>true</K> may be not successful.
First, it might be the case that no server is reachable.
And second, if one can in principle <E>download</E> files from a server then
it might be impossible to actually <E>store</E> these files 
in the data directories of the installed package;
in this case, it is advisable to install the whole package
or just its data directories in a private directory,
see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="GAP Root Directory" BookName="ref"/> for details.

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<Subsection Label="subsect:Adding and Removing Servers">
<Heading>Adding and Removing Servers</Heading>

When access to remote data is enabled
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="subsect:Local or remote access"/>)
then the available servers are given by the <C>servers</C> component
of the global variable <Ref Var="AtlasOfGroupRepresentationsInfo"/>.

<P/>

<E>Removing</E> entries from this list means to disable access to the
corresponding servers,
<E>adding</E> entries makes the corresponding servers available.
Of course the latter makes sense only if the new servers really exist,
for example in a local network.

<P/>

Currently there is just one remote server.
As soon as other servers become available, or a server name is changed
which makes it necessary to adjust the <C>servers</C> component,
this will be announced in the &GAP; Forum, cf.
<Ref Sect="Further Information about GAP" BookName="tut"/>.
The same holds when upgrades of the package become available.

<Heading>Compressed or Uncompressed Data Files</Heading>

When used with UNIX, &GAP; can read <F>gzip</F>ped files,
see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Saving and Loading a Workspace" BookName="ref"/>.
If the component <C>compress</C>
<Index Key ="compress"><C>compress</C></Index>
of <Ref Var="AtlasOfGroupRepresentationsInfo"/> has the value <K>true</K>
then each &MeatAxe; format file that is fetched from a remote
server is afterwards compressed with <F>gzip</F>.
<Index Key ="gzip"><F>gzip</F></Index>
This saves a lot of space if many &MeatAxe; format files are accessed.
(Note that data files in other formats are very small.)
For example, at the time of the release of version&nbsp;1.4 there were about
<M>8\,400</M> data files in &MeatAxe; format,
which needed about <M>1\,400</M> MB in uncompressed text format
and about <M>275</M> MB in compressed text format.

<Subsection Label="subsect:Customizing the Access to Data files">
<Heading>Customizing the Access to Data Files</Heading>

By default, local data files are stored in the subdirectories <F>datagens</F>
and <F>dataword</F> of the package, and the files are exactly the text files
provided on the servers.
However, a more flexible approach may be useful.

<P/>

First, one may want to use <E>different file formats</E>,
for example the &MeatAxe; binary files that are provided by the servers
parallel to the &MeatAxe; text files.
Second, one may want to use <E>a different directory structure</E>,
for example the same structure as used on the servers
&ndash;this makes sense for example if a local mirror of a server
is available, because then one can read the server files directly,
without transferring/copying them to another directory.

<P/>

As a consequence, one would like to customize the meaning of the following
three access steps.

<P/>

<List>
<Mark>Are the required filed locally available?</Mark>
<Item>
  The required files may have a different name or a different path,
  and the data can be available in one file or can be distributed to several
  files.
</Item>
<Mark>How can a file be made locally available?</Mark>
<Item>
  A different server file may be fetched
  or some postprocessing may be required.
</Item>
<Mark>How is the data of a file accessed by &GAP;?</Mark>
<Item>
  A different function may be needed to read the file.
</Item>
</List>

Details how to achieve this can be found in Section
<Ref Sect="sect:How to Customize the Access to Data files"/>.

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<Subsection Label="subsect:Reading large matrices over finite fields">
<Heading>Reading Large Matrices over Finite Fields</Heading>

Matrices over finite fields in &GAP; can be represented in a compressed
format that needs less space than the corresponding text file.
Such a &MeatAxe; format text file can be read by
<Ref Func="ScanMeatAxeFile"/> either line by line (which is the default)
or as a whole; the latter is faster but needs more space than the former.
For example, a <M>4\,370</M> by <M>4\,370</M> matrix over the field
with two elements 
(as occurs for an irreducible representation of the Baby Monster) requires
less than <M>3</M> MB space in &GAP; but the corresponding &MeatAxe; format
text file is more than <M>19</M> MB large,
which means that when one reads the file with the fast variant,
&GAP; will temporarily grow by more than this value.
One can change the mode by setting the global variable
<Ref Var="CMeatAxe.FastRead"/> to <K>true</K> or <K>false</K>, respectively.

<P/>

Note that this parameter is meaningful only when 
<Ref Func="ScanMeatAxeFile"/> is used.
It has no effect for example if &MeatAxe; binary files are read,
cf.&nbsp;<Ref Func="FFMatOrPermCMtxBinary"/>.

  In addition to the group orders that were added in version 1.3
  (see Section <Ref Sect="sect:What's New in Version 1.3?"/>),
  also many orders of maximal subgroups are now available.
  These values occur in the records returned by <Ref Func="AtlasProgram"/>

  For this feature, the function <Ref Func="AGRGNAN"/> was generalized,
  the function <Ref Func="AtlasOfGroupRepresentationsTestWords"/> was
  improved for <C>"maxes"</C> type programs, and the function

  In many cases, straight line programs for computing generators of maximal

  generators of maximal subgroups of downward extensions of <M>G</M>;
  if not then it may suffice to extend the given straight line programs by
  additional generators,
  see <Ref Func="AtlasOfGroupRepresentationsTestCompatibleMaxes"/>.
  <P/>
  Currently this yields more than <M>200</M> more possibilities to compute
  maximal subgroups, this means a growth by about <M>25</M> percent.
  For example, all maximal subgroups of <M>12.M_{22}</M> and <M>2.Fi_{22}</M>
  can now be accessed via <Ref Func="AtlasGenerators"/>.
  <P/>
  (Of course this extension means only that one can access the straight
  line programs in question automatically via the &GAP; interface.
  In principle one could have used them already before, by explicitly
  applying a straight line program for a factor group to generators of a
  group, and perhaps adding some element in the kernel of the natural
  epimorphism.)

  For this feature,
  information about the compatibility of standard generators of groups and
  their factor groups was added,

<Subsection Label="sect:What's New in Version 1.3.1?">
<Heading>What's New in Version 1.3.1?</Heading>
 
This version was mainly released in order to fix a few problems.
Now one does not get warnings about unbound variables
when the package is loaded
and the &GAP; package <Package>IO</Package> <Cite Key="IO"/>
is not available,
and pathological situations in <Ref Func="FFMatOrPermCMtxBinary"/>
(concerning extremely short corrupted data files and different
byte orderings in binary files) are handled more carefully.

<P/>

Besides this, the two functions
<Ref Func="AtlasGroup" Label="for various arguments"/> and
<Ref Func="AtlasSubgroup" Label="for a group name (and various arguments) and a number"/> were introduced,
and the extended function <Ref Func="QuaternionAlgebra" BookName="ref"/>
of &GAP;&nbsp;4.4.10 can now be used for describing base rings in
<Ref Func="OneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo"/> and
<Ref Func="AllAtlasGeneratingSetInfos"/>.
(This is the reason why this version of the package requires at least
version 4.4.10 of &GAP;.)

<List>
<Item>
  The database was extended, see
  Section&nbsp;<Ref Subsect="subsect:Compressed or uncompressed data files"/>
  for the number and size of files.
</Item>
<Item>
  New data types and corresponding &GAP; objects have been introduced,
  for representing semi-presentations, presentations,
  and programs for finding standard generators.
  For details, see
  <Ref Func="AtlasProgram"/>,
  Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="chap:utilities"/>, and
  Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Filenames Used in the AGR"/>.
</Item>
<Item>
  The records returned by the functions <Ref Func="AtlasGenerators"/>,
  <Ref Func="OneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo"/>, and
  <Ref Func="AllAtlasGeneratingSetInfos"/>
  now contain the name and (if known) the order of the group in question,
  and also components describing the degree in the case of permutation
  representations
  or the dimension and the base ring of the natural module in the case of
  matrix representations.
</Item>
<Item>
  For many of the groups, information about the minimal degree of faithful
  permutation representations and the minimal dimensions of faithful matrix
  representations in various characteristics is available for
  <Ref Func="DisplayAtlasInfo"/>,
  <Ref Func="OneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo"/>, and
  <Ref Func="AllAtlasGeneratingSetInfos"/>,
  see also Section <Ref Sect="sect:Representations of Minimal Degree"/>.
  For these functions,
  also properties such as <Ref Func="IsPrimeInt" BookName="ref"/> can be used
  to describe the intended restriction of the output.
</Item>
<Item>
  One can now use <Ref Func="Pager" BookName="ref"/> in
  <Ref Func="DisplayAtlasInfo"/>,
  see Section&nbsp;<Ref Subsect="subsect:Customizing DisplayAtlasInfo"/>.

  <P/>

  An interactive alternative to <Ref Func="DisplayAtlasInfo"/> is provided by
  the function <Ref Func="BrowseAtlasInfo" BookName="Browse"/> from the
  new (recommended) &GAP; package <Package>Browse</Package>
  <Cite Key="Browse1.2"/>.
</Item>
<Item>
  The functions <Ref Func="OneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo"/> and
  <Ref Func="AllAtlasGeneratingSetInfos"/> now admit also
  a list of group names as the first argument.
</Item>
<Item>
  The functions for actually accessing the data are more flexible now, see
  Section&nbsp;<Ref Subsect="subsect:Customizing the Access to Data files"/>.
</Item>
<Item>
  For transferring remote data,
  the &GAP; package <Package>IO</Package> <Cite Key="IO"/>
  can now be used (and is recommended) as an alternative to <F>wget</F>,
  <Index Key="wget"><F>wget</F></Index>
  see
  Section&nbsp;<Ref Subsect="subsect:Accessing data files with wget or IO"/>.
</Item>
<Item>
  The address of the data server has changed.
  <Index Key="ftp"><F>ftp</F></Index>
  Since the access to the server is no longer possible via <F>ftp</F>,
  the mechanim used up to version 1.2, which was based on <F>ftp</F>,
  had to be rewritten.

  <P/>

  The main consequence of this change is that information about updates
  of the table of contents is now provided at the package's homepage.
  This means that on the one hand,
  now package users cannot <E>compute</E> the table of contents directly
  from the server data,
  but on the other hand the update information can be <E>downloaded</E>
  without the necessity to install <F>perl</F>.
  <Index Key="perl"><F>perl</F></Index>

  <P/>

  Another consequence is that the system program <F>ls</F> is no longer
  needed,
  see Section&nbsp;<Ref Subsect="sect:What's New in Version 1.1?"/>.
</Item>
<Item>
  The package manual has been restructured, extended and improved.
  It is now based on the package &GAPDoc; <Cite Key="GAPDoc"/>.
</Item>
</List>

</Subsection>


<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<Subsection Label="sect:What's New in Version 1.2?">
<Heading>What's New in Version 1.2?</Heading>

Not much.

<P/>

The release of Version&nbsp;1.2 became necessary first of all
in order to provide a package version that is compatible with &GAP;&nbsp;4.4,
since some cross-references into the &GAP; Reference Manual were broken
due to changes of section names.
Additionally, several web addresses concerning the package itself
were changed and thus had to be adjusted.

<P/>

This opportunity was used
<List>
<Item>
    to upgrade the administrational part for
    loading the package to the mechanism that is recommended
    for &GAP;&nbsp;4.4,
</Item>
<Item>
    to extend the test suite, 
    which now covers more consistency checks using
    the &GAP; Character Table Library&nbsp;<Cite Key="CTblLib1.1.3"/>,
</Item>
<Item>
    to make the function <Ref Func="ScanMeatAxeFile"/> more robust,
    due to the fact that the &GAP; function
    <Ref Func="PermList" BookName="ref"/> now
    returns <K>fail</K> instead of raising an error,
</Item>
<Item>
    to change the way how representations with prescribed properties are
    accessed (the new function <Ref Func="OneAtlasGeneratingSetInfo"/> is now
    preferred to the former <C>OneAtlasGeneratingSet</C>,
    and <Ref Func="AllAtlasGeneratingSetInfos"/>
    has been added in order to provide programmatic access in parallel to the
    human readable descriptions printed by <Ref Func="DisplayAtlasInfo"/>),
</Item>
<Item>
    and last but not least to include the current table of contents of the
    underlying database.
</Item>
</List>

<P/>

For <Package>AtlasRep</Package> users,
the new feature of &GAP;&nbsp;4.4 is particularly
interesting that due to better kernel support, reading large matrices
over finite fields is now faster than it was in &GAP;&nbsp;4.3.

</Subsection>


<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<Subsection Label="sect:What's New in Version 1.1?">
<Heading>What's New in Version 1.1?</Heading>

The biggest change w.r.t.&nbsp;Version&nbsp;1.1 is the addition of
private extensions
(see Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="chap:Private Extensions"/>).
It includes a new <Q>free format</Q> for straight line programs
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Effect of Private Extensions"/>).
Unfortunately, this feature requires the system program <F>ls</F>,
so it may be not available for example under MS Windows operating systems.
[But see Section&nbsp;<Ref Subsect="sect:What's New in Version 1.3?"/>.]

<P/>

In order to admit the addition of other types of data,
the implementation of several functions has been changed.
Data types are described in
Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Data Types Used in the AGR"/>.
An example of a new data type are quaternionic representations
(see Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Filenames Used in the AGR"/>).
The user interface itself
(see Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="chap:The User Interface of the AtlasRep Package"/>)
remained the same.

<P/>

<Index Key="wget"><F>wget</F></Index>
As an alternative to <C>perl</C>, one can use <C>wget</C> now
for transferring data files
(see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:User Parameters for the AtlasRep Package"/>).

<P/>

Data files can be read much more efficiently in &GAP;&nbsp;4.3 than in
&GAP;&nbsp;4.2.
In Version&nbsp;1.1 of the <Package>AtlasRep</Package> package,
this feature is used for reading
matrices and permutations in &MeatAxe; text format with
<Ref Func="ScanMeatAxeFile"/>.
As a consequence, (at least) &GAP;&nbsp;4.3 is required for
<Package>AtlasRep</Package> Version&nbsp;1.1.

<P/>

<Index Key="gzip"><F>gzip</F></Index>
The new <C>compress</C> component of the global variable
<Ref Var="AtlasOfGroupRepresentationsInfo"/>
allows one to store data files automatically in <F>gzip</F>ped form.

<P/>

For matrix representations in characteristic zero, invariant forms and
generators for the centralizer algebra are now accessible in &GAP; if they
are contained in the source files --this information had been ignored in
Version&nbsp;1.0
(see&nbsp;<Ref
Func="AtlasOfGroupRepresentationsTestTableOfContentsRemoteUpdates"/>
for necessary updates).

<P/>

Additional information is now available via the internet
(see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Web Services for the AtlasRep Package"/>).

<P/>

The update facilities have been extended
(see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Maintaining the Local Data of the AtlasRep Package"/>).

<P/>

The manual is now distributed also in pdf and HTML format; on the other hand,
the PostScript format manual is no longer contained in the archives.

<P/>

Apart from these changes,
a few minor bugs in the handling of &MeatAxe; files have been fixed,
typos in the documentation have been corrected,
and the syntax checks for &ATLAS; straight line programs
(see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="sect:Reading and Writing Atlas Straight Line Programs"/>)
have been improved.

The perl script<Index Key="perl"><F>perl</F></Index>
that had been used for fetching remote data until version&nbsp;1.2
had been kindly provided by Frank Lübeck and Max Neunhöffer.
Thanks also to Greg Gamble and Alexander Hulpke for technical hints
concerning <Q>standard</Q> perl.

<P/>

Ulrich Kaiser helped with preparing the package for MS Windows.

<P/>

The idea to support private extensions of the package
(see Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="chap:Private Extensions"/>)
is due to Klaus Lux.
He used a preliminary version of <Package>AtlasRep</Package> Version&nbsp;1.1,
and helped to fix several bugs.

<P/>

The functions <Ref Func="CMtxBinaryFFMatOrPerm"/> and
<Ref Func="FFMatOrPermCMtxBinary"/> were contributed by Frank Lübeck.

<P/>

The &GAPDoc; package <Cite Key="GAPDoc"/>,
which is used for processing the package manual,
was written by Frank Lübeck and Max Neunhöffer.

<P/>

The &GAP; package <Package>IO</Package> <Cite Key="IO"/>,
which is recommended for transferring data,
was written by Max Neunhöffer.

<P/>

Max has also suggested the generalization of the data access described in
Section&nbsp;<Ref Subsect="subsect:Customizing the Access to Data files"/>.

<P/>

Gunter Malle had suggested to make the information about representations
of minimal degree accessible.

<P/>

Andries Brouwer suggested to add a tutorial,
see Chapter <Ref Chap="chap:tutorial"/>.
