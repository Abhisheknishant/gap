The following table lists the information of the Atlas of Group
Representations that is available via the GAP interface.
One line is shown for each group G, with the following columns.

<dl>
<dt>
group
</dt>
<dd>
    the GAP name of G (see Section

    Used in the AtlasRep Package"</a>
    in the manual of the package),
</dd>

<dt>
#
</dt>
<dd>
    the number of representations stored for G,
</dd>

<dt>
maxes
</dt>
<dd>
    the available straight line programs
    for computing generators of maximal subgroups of G,
</dd>

<dt>
cl
</dt>
<dd>
    a `+' sign if at least one program for computing representatives
    of conjugacy classes of elements of G is stored,
    and a `-' sign otherwise,
</dd>

<dt>
cyc
</dt>
<dd>
    a `+' sign if at least one program for computing representatives of
    classes of maximally cyclic subgroups of G is stored,

    descriptions of outer automorphisms of G for which at least one
    program is stored,
</dd>

<dt>

    a `+' sign if at least one black box program for computing
    standard generators is stored,
    and a `-' sign otherwise,
</dd>

<dt>
check
</dt>
<dd>
    a `+' sign if at least one program is stored for deciding whether
    given generators are standard generators,
    and a `-' sign otherwise, and
</dd>

<dt>
pres
</dt>
<dd>
    a `+' sign if at least one presentation in terms of the
