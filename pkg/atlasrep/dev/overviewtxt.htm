<p>
The following table lists the information of the Atlas of Group
Representations that is available via the GAP interface.
One line is shown for each group G, with the following columns.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>group</dt>
<dd>
    the main GAP name of G (see Section
    <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/atlasrep/doc/chap2.html#sect:groupnames">"Group Names Used in the AtlasRep Package"</a>
    in the manual of the package),
</dd>
<dt>#</dt>
<dd>
    the number of faithful representations stored for G,
</dd>
<dt>maxes</dt>
<dd>
    the number of available straight line programs
    for computing generators of maximal subgroups of G,
</dd>
<dt>cl</dt>
<dd>
    a + sign if at least one program for computing representatives
    of conjugacy classes of elements of G is stored,
</dd>
<dt>cyc</dt>
<dd>
    a + sign if at least one program for computing representatives
    of classes of maximally cyclic subgroups of G is stored,
</dd>
<dt>out</dt>
<dd>
    descriptions of outer automorphisms of G for which at least one
    program is stored,
</dd>
<dt>fnd</dt>
<dd>
    a + sign if at least one program is available for finding
    standard generators,
</dd>
<dt>chk</dt>
<dd>
    a + sign if at least one program is available for checking
    whether a set of generators is a set of standard generators,
</dd>
<dt>prs</dt>
<dd>
    a + sign if at least one program is available that encodes a
    presentation,
