This list contains the changes in the {\GAP} Library of Tables of Marks
since the release of TomLib~1.0 (together with {\GAP}~4.3) in May 2002.
We denote mathematical errors by {\bf ***} and new information
by {\bf NEW}\null.
We use {\bf C} to denote changes that are not obviously corrections;
the number of these changes is kept small.

{\bf Release of TomLib~1.1.1 (December 2003)}

Changes are assigned to the simple group involved,
and shown in alphabetical order.

***&{^3}D_4(2)&:&The derived subgroups for the classes $2847$ and $2848$
were corrected, they are in the classes $2823$ and $2827$, respectively
(not $2847$ and $2848$)
\contrib{by Thomas Breuer}.\cr
***&&:&The derived subgroups for the last classes in the maximal
subgroups $S_3 \times L_2(8)$ and $(7 \times L_2(7)):3$ were corrected,
they are in the last but one class not in the last
\contrib{by Thomas Breuer}.\cr
***&Co_3&:&The derived subgroups for the classes $2018$, $2318$, and $2457$
in $Co_3$ were corrected, they are in the classes $1435$, $2048$, and $2442$,
respectively (not $2018$, $2318$, and $2457$)
\contrib{by Thomas Breuer}.\cr
***&&:&The derived subgroups for the last classes in the maximal subgroups
$2 \times M_{12}$, $S_3 \times L_2(8):3$, and $A_4 \times S_5$ were
corrected, they are in the classes $514$, $139$, and $138$, respectively
(not $515$, $144$, and $146$)
\contrib{by Thomas Breuer}.\cr
***&L_3(4)&:&The derived subgroups for the class $199$ in $3.L_3(4).2_3$
were corrected, they are in the class $198$ not $199$
\contrib{by Thomas Breuer}.\cr
***&&:&The generators for the representative of the class $706$ in
$2^2.L_3(4).2_2$ were replaced;
the former generators belonged to a group in class $705$
\contrib{by Thomas Breuer}.\cr
***&O_8^-(2)&:&The straight line programs were corrected;
up to now, the corresponding data stored in the table did not describe
valid straight line programs
\contrib{by Thomas Breuer}.\cr
***&&:&The derived subgroups for the last class in the maximal
subgroup $(S_3 \times S_3 \times A_5):2$ of $O_8^-(2)$ were corrected,
they are in the class $362$ not $368$
\contrib{by Thomas Breuer}.\cr
***&U_3(4)&:&The derived subgroups for the class $80$ in $U_3(4).2$
were corrected, they are in the class $79$ not $80$
\contrib{by Thomas Breuer}.\cr
***&U_4(2)&:&The generators for the representative of the class $110$
in the maximal subgroup $2.(A_4 \times A_4).2.2$ of $U_4(2).2$ were replaced;
the former generators belonged to a group of order $24$ not $12$,
which was conjugate to the representative of class $152$
\contrib{by Thomas Breuer}.\cr
***&U_4(3)&:&The generators for the representatives of the classes $575$ and
$595$ in $U_4(3).2_1$ were replaced; the former generators belonged to groups
of order $192$ not $96$, which were conjugate to the representative of class
$709$
