Before running 'configure' make sure that '/usr/ucb' precedes '/bin' and
'/usr/bin' in your PATH environment variable. If not you can achieve this with
the commands

PATH=/usr/ucb:$PATH
export PATH

or (for csh and tcsh users)

setenv PATH /usr/ucb:$PATH

Otherwise 'configure' will not be able to generate correct configuration
files. Most likely 'config.h' will be broken.
