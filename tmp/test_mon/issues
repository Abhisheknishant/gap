TO DO LIST
==========

- method for elements and immediate metho for size for a 
  magma with a zero ajoined (in case size of original smg are know)

- Immediate method for Size of Rees Matrix Semigroup given size
	of underlying semigroup	DONE 

- Rees congruence from ideal - make them sensible! DONE

- Sims describes in his book the wreath product of two ordering.
	Perhaps that would be interesting to look at. 

- IsomorphismTransformationSemigroup
	for finite semigroups 										NOT DONE
fp semigroups (just todd coxeter here). 		DONE

- On our slightly longer term todo list-
	complete a multiplication table. Given a partial multiplication
	table fill it in so that the resulting table describes a semigroup.



ISSUES
======

- Method for adjoining a zero to a fp semigroup, so that the 
	obtained smg is still fp
- fp / cong : do sensible thing, ie, return an fp semigroup DONE
SOLUTION:
- in the case when we have an fp smg and want to do a 
  quotient or adjoining a zero create an isomorphism
  to an fp semigroup

	the case when we have a semigroup
