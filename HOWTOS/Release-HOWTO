- The names and modules in doc/tut/authors.tex have to be brought up-to-date.

- Run tests:
  o The sanity test runs up to size 64 and degree 12 without problems.
  o The transitive groups construction (Alexander) runs correctly for all
    degrees.
  o The manual files should produce no discrepancies under doc/test/testexample
  o `testall' should produce no errors (also under Windows)
  o The error list from the bugfixes for the previous release  should
    produce no errors.

- Edit
    lib/version.g
    src/system.c (SyKernelVersion,SyWindowsPath)
    doc/build/config.{install,new},
    WWW/Util/DEFAULTS
    
    to give the new version number

See mkdistrib/HOWTO for how to do the actual wrapping
