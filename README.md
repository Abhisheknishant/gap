# What is GAP?

GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra, with particular emphasis on
Computational Group Theory. GAP provides a programming language, a library of
thousands of functions implementing algebraic algorithms written in the GAP
language as well as large data libraries of algebraic objects. See also the
[overview](http://gap-system.org/Overview/overview.html) and the description of
the [mathematical capabilities](http://gap-system.org/Overview/Capabilities/capabilities.html).

GAP is used in research and teaching for studying groups and their representations,
rings, vector spaces, algebras, combinatorial structures, and more.
The system, including source, is distributed freely. You can study and easily
modify or extend it for your special use.

In July 2008, GAP was awarded the ACM/SIGSAM Richard Dimick Jenks Memorial Prize
for Excellence in Software Engineering applied to Computer Algebra.

# How to obtain GAP?

The current release is GAP 4.7.7 and it can be obtained from our
[downloads page](http://www.gap-system.org/Releases/index.html).

You can compile the current development version of GAP from this repository
by the follwing two commands
```
# ./configure
# make
```
If everything goes well, you should be able to start GAP by executing
```
# sh bin/gap.sh
```
