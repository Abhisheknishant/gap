# What is GAP?

`GAP` is a system for computational discrete algebra, with particular emphasis on
Computational Group Theory. GAP provides a programming language, a library of
thousands of functions implementing algebraic algorithms written in the GAP
language as well as large data libraries of algebraic objects. See also the
overview and the description of the mathematical capabilities.
`GAP` is used in research and teaching for studying groups and their representations,
rings, vector spaces, algebras, combinatorial structures, and more.
The system, including source, is distributed freely. You can study and easily
modify or extend it for your special use.

In July 2008, GAP was awarded the ACM/SIGSAM Richard Dimick Jenks Memorial Prize
for Excellence in Software Engineering applied to Computer Algebra.

# How to obtain GAP?

The current release is `GAP` 4.7.7 and it can be obtained from our downloads page. This website describes this release if not stated otherwise. Changes from earlier versions are described in the release history.

# We welcome contributions

The `GAP` Project welcomes contributions from everyone, in the shape of code,
documentation, blog posts, or research papers. For code contributions, please
read the [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
