\>PrimitiveGroup( <deg>, <nr> )

{\GAP} contains a library of primitive permutation groups which includes,
up to  isomorphism of permutation groups   (i.e., up to conjugacy  in the
corresponding symmetric group)
{\parindent\manindent
\item{$\bullet$} all   primitive permutation  groups  of  degree $\<256$,
  namely
\itemitem{$\circ$}  the  primitive permutation  groups   up to degree~50,
  calculated by C.~Sims,
\itemitem{$\circ$}  the  solvable (hence  affine)   primitive permutation
  groups of degree $\<256$, calculated by M.~Short \cite{Short92},
\itemitem{$\circ$} the insolvable affine  primitive permutation groups of
  degree $\<256$, calculated in \cite{Theissen97},
\item{$\bullet$} the non-affine primitive   permutation groups of  degree
  $\<1000$,  described   in   \cite{DixonMortimer88},  with    generators
  calculated in \cite{Theissen97}.\par}
Note that the affine primitive permutation groups of degrees 256--999 are
not included.

\>OnePrimitiveGroup( $<attr>_1$, $<val>_1$, \dots\ )

For compatibility  with earlier versions  of {\GAP}, the original list of
Sims,  with  the same numbers  and  the  names  given by  Buekenhout  and
Leemans,  is     also  included.   It is    accessed     by  the function
`PrimitiveGroupSims'.   You   can   also use  the    well-known functions
`AllPrimitiveGroups' and `OnePrimitiveGroup' with this old list.
