<Chapter Label="Preface">
<Heading>Preface</Heading>
<Index Key="About GAP manual">About &GAP; manual</Index>

Welcome to &GAP;. 
This is one of two manuals documenting the core part of &GAP;, 
the other being the <E>&GAP; Tutorial</E>
<Alt Only="HTML">(see <Ref BookName="tut" Label="Preface"/>)</Alt>.
<P/>
This preface serves not only to introduce <Q>The &GAP; Reference Manual</Q>, 
but also as an introduction to the whole system.
<P/>
&GAP; stands  for  <E>Groups, Algorithms  and Programming</E>.  The  name was
chosen to reflect  the aim of  the  system, which  is introduced in  this
reference manual.  Since  that  choice,  the  system has become   somewhat
broader,    and  you will  also   find information   about algorithms and
programming  for other   algebraic structures,   such as semigroups   and
algebras.
<P/>
This manual, the <E>&GAP; reference manual</E> contains the official definitions
of &GAP; functions. It should give all information to someone who wants to
use &GAP; as it is, and it is not intended to be read cover-to-cover.
<P/>
To get started a new user may first look at parts of the <E>&GAP; Tutorial</E> 
<Alt Only="HTML">(see <Ref BookName="tut" Label="Preface"/>)</Alt>. 
<P/>
A lot of the functionality of the system and a number of
contributed extensions are provided as <Q>&GAP; packages</Q>
which are developed independently of the core part of &GAP; and can be loaded
into a &GAP; session. Each package comes with a separate manual which is 
also available from the &GAP; help system.
<P/>
This manual is divided into chapters, sections and subsections.
Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="The Help System"/> describes the <E>help system</E>,
which provides access to all  manuals from a running &GAP; session.
Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="Running GAP"/> gives technical advice for 
<E>running</E> &GAP;. Chapter&nbsp;<Ref Chap="The Programming Language"/> 
introduces the &GAP; language, while the next chapters deal with the 
<E>environment</E> provided by &GAP; for the user. These are followed by 
the main bulk of chapters which is devoted to various mathematical 
structures that &GAP; can handle.
<P/>
Subsequent sections of this preface explain the structure of the
system and the arrangements for the attribution of credit for
authorship and maintenance of the system; acknowledge those who have
made particular contributions to this and previous releases and
provide copyright and licensing information.

<Heading>Authors and Maintainers</Heading>

Early versions of &GAP; have simply included the increasingly long
list of all of the authors of the system with no indication as to who
contributed what. With &GAP; 4.3 we have introduced a new concept:
<E>modules</E>, to allow us to report the authorship of the system in more
detail. A module is a part of &GAP; which provides identifiable
functionality and has reasonably clean interfaces with the rest of the
system (usually it consists of separate files). Each module has its
own lists of authors and maintainers, which are not necessarily the
same. A preliminary list of modules and their attributions appears in
this manual. Note that we are still in the process of identifying
modules within the system, so large parts of the system do not yet
fall into any module. Since also we all collaborate closely in
designing, developing and debugging the system, it should not be
assumed that the list of modules in this manual represents all of
everyone's contribution, or that it lists everyone who made any
contribution at all to each module.
<P/>

<#Include SYSTEM "../tut/authors.xml">
<P/>

All &GAP; packages are also considered to be modules and have their
own authors and maintainers. It should however be noted that some
packages provide interfaces between &GAP; and an external program, a
copy of which is included for convenience, and that, in these cases,
we do not claim that the module authors or maintainers wrote, or
maintain, this external program. Similarly, some modules and packages
include large data libraries that may have been computed by many
people. We try to make clear in each case what credit is attributable
to whom.
<P/>
We have, for some time, operated a refereeing system for contributed
packages, both to ensure the quality of the software we distribute,
and to provide recognition for the authors. We now consider this to be
a refereeing system for modules, and we would note, in particular
that, although it does not use the standard package interface, the
library of small groups has been refereed and accepted on exactly the
same basis as the accepted  packages.
<P/>
We also include with this distribution a
number of packages which have not (yet) gone through our refereeing
process. Some may be accepted in the future, in other cases the
authors have chosen not to submit them.  More information can be found
on our World Wide Web site 
(see Section <Ref Sect="Further Information about GAP"/>).

<Heading>Acknowledgements</Heading>

Very many people have worked on, and contributed to, &GAP; over the
years since its inception. On our Web site you will find the prefaces
to the previous releases, each of which acknowledges people who have
made special contributions to that release. Even so, it is appropriate
to mention here Joachim Neubüser whose vision of a free,
open and extensible system for computational algebra inspired &GAP;
in the first place, and Martin Schönert, who was the
technical architect of &GAP; 3 and &GAP; 4.
<P/>
In the past years &GAP; development
has become a more and more widely distributed operation, and
increasingly dependent on hard voluntary work by developers not solely
or mainly employed to work on &GAP;. 
<P/>
Nevertheless, the development
process has remained constructive and friendly, even when wrangling
over difficult technical decisions, or sensitive questions of
attribution and credit and we must express our huge gratitude to
everyone involved for this.
<P/>
We would like to thank the many people who have made contributions of
various kinds to the development of &GAP; since 1986, in particular:

<P/>
The list of modules which appears in this manual now gives a partial
idea of the contributions of different people, but we would like to
mention some people who have made important contributions to the
development process over the last years that do not show up there:
<P/>
Steve Linton has been leading the &GAP; group in St Andrews over the last
years and continues to be the main kernel maintainer and developer. The group
in St Andrews also maintains most of the development infrastructure and 
helps with user support.
<P/>
Thomas Breuer continues to develop many areas of the system, and
to play a vital role in clarifying our underlying concepts, despite
now working in industry.
<P/>
Frank Lübeck set up a new system for automatic handling of
packages and helped with various kernel issues.
<P/>
Bettina Eick and her research group in Braunschweig have contributed much
functionality, mainly in the form of packages.
<P/>
Max Neunhöffer has brought much fresh insight to bear on the
design of crucial parts of the system, and also done a lot of the
ensuing work; Stefan Kohl and Volkmar Felsch have both brought
enormous persistence to pointing out errors and inconsistencies in code and 
documentation, improving error messages and generally polishing the
system; and very many others have contributed ideas, insight and hard
work to produce this release. Senior colleagues, especially Joachim
Neubüser, Edmund Robertson, and Charley Wright, continue to
provide encouragement support and constructive criticism.
<P/>
The manual tries to give credit to designers and implementors of major parts
of &GAP;, mentioning many of them in Section <Ref Sect="Authors and Maintainers"/>.
However, for many parts of the &GAP; code it is impossible to give
detailed credit, because over the time of its development many persons 
have contributed from first ideas, even in prerunners of &GAP; such as 
<Package>CAS</Package> or <Package>SOGOS</Package>, via first 
implementations, improvements, and even total reimplementations.
The documentation of the code gives further details, but
again, it suffers from the same problem. We have attempted to give
attributions with the different chapters of the manual where this seemed
to be possible, but we apologise for all (unavoidable) shortcomings of
this attempt.
