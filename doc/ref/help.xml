<Chapter Label="The Help System">
<Heading>The Help System</Heading>

This chapter describes the &GAP; help system. The help system lets you read
the documentation interactively.


<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<Section Label="Invoking the Help">
<Heading>Invoking the Help</Heading>

The  basic command  to  read  &GAP;'s documentation  from  within a  &GAP;
session is as follows.
<P/>
<Index>getting help</Index>
<C>?[<A>book</A>:][?]<A>topic</A></C>
<P/>
For an explanation and some examples
see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Help" BookName="tut"/>.
<P/>
Note that the first question mark must appear in the <E>first position</E>
after the <C>gap> </C> prompt.
The search strings <A>book</A> and <A>topic</A> are normalized in a certain
way (see the end of this section for details) before the search starts.
This makes the search case insensitive and there can be arbitrary white space
after the first question mark.
<!-- %%      Throw away? (FL)  -->
<!-- %%  The help command <C>?</C> displays the section with the name <A>section</A> on the -->
<!-- %%  screen. For example <C>?Help</C> will display this section on the screen. -->
<!-- %%  You should not type in the single quotes. They are only used in help -->
<!-- %%  sections to delimit text that you should enter into &GAP; or that &GAP; -->
<!-- %%  prints in response. When the whole section has been displayed the normal -->
<!-- %%  &GAP; prompt <C>gap></C> is shown and normal &GAP; interaction resumes. -->
<P/>
When there are several manual sections  that match the query a numbered list
of topics is displayed.
These matches can be accessed with <C>?<A>number</A></C>.
<P/>
<!-- %%  Section&nbsp;<Ref ???="Reading Sections"/> tells you what actions you can perform -->
<!-- %%  while you are reading a section. You tell &GAP; to display this -->
<!-- %%  section by entering <C>?Reading Sections</C>, without quotes. -->
<!-- %%  Section&nbsp;<Ref ???="Format of Sections"/> describes the format of sections and the -->
<!-- %%  conventions used, -->
<P/>
There  are  some  further  specially   handled  commands  which  start  with
a  question  mark.
They are explained in
Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Browsing through the Sections"/>.
<P/>
As default &GAP; shows the help  sections as text in the terminal (window),
page by  page if the shown  text does not fit  on the screen. But  there are
several other choices to read (other formats of) the documents: via a viewer
for <C>dvi</C> files (produced by &TeX;)
or files in Acrobat's <C>pdf</C> format or via a web browser.
This is explained in Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Changing the Help Viewer"/>.
<!-- %%  lists the commands you use to flip -->
<!-- %%  through sections, <Ref ???="Redisplaying a Section"/> describes how to read a -->
<!-- %%  section again, <Ref ???="Abbreviating Section Names"/> tells you how to avoid typing -->
<!-- %%  the long section names, and <Ref ???="Help Index"/> describes the index command. -->
<P/>
<E>Details of the string normalization process</E>
<P/>
Here now is precisely how the search strings <A>book</A> and <A>topic</A> are
normalized before a search starts:
backslashes and double or single quotes are removed,
parentheses and braces are substituted by blanks,
non-ASCII characters are considered as ISO-latin1 characters
and the accented letters are substituted by their non-accented counterpart.
Finally white space is normalized.

<Section Label="Browsing through the Sections">
<Heading>Browsing through the Sections</Heading>

Help books for &GAP; are organized in chapters, sections, and subsections.
There are a few special commands starting with a question mark (in the first
position after the <C>gap> </C> prompt) which allow browsing a book section
or chapter wise.
<P/>

<Index>browsing forward</Index>
<C>?></C>
<P/>
<Index>browsing backwards</Index>
<C>?&lt;</C>
<P/>
The two help commands <C>?&lt;</C> and <C>?></C> allow one to browse through
a whole help book.
<C>?&lt;</C> displays the section preceding the previously shown section,
and <C>?></C> takes you to the section following the previously shown one.
<P/>
<Index>browsing forward one chapter</Index>
<C>?>></C>
<P/>
<Index>browsing backwards one chapter</Index>
<C>?&lt;&lt;</C>
<P/>
<C>?&lt;&lt;</C> takes you back to the first section of the current chapter,
which gives an overview of the sections described in this chapter.
If you are already in this section <C>?&lt;&lt;</C> takes you to the first
section of the previous chapter.
<C>?>></C> takes you to the first section of the next chapter.
<P/>
<Index>browsing the previous section browsed</Index>
<C>?-</C>
<P/>
<Index>browsing the next section browsed</Index>
<C>?+</C>
<P/>
&GAP; remembers the last few sections that you have read.
<C>?-</C> takes you to the one that you have read before the current one,
and displays it again.
Further applications of <C>?-</C> take you further back in this history.
<C>?+</C> reverses this process, i.e., it takes you back to the section that
you have read after the current one.
It is important to note that <C>?-</C>  and <C>?+</C> do not alter the
history like the other help commands.
<P/>
<Index>list of available books</Index>
<C>?books</C>
<P/>
This command shows a list of the books which are currently known to the help
system. For each book there is a short name which is used with the
<A>book</A> part of the basic help query
and there is a long name which hopefully tells you what this book is about.
<P/>
A short name which ends in <C>(not loaded)</C> refers to a &GAP; package
whose documentation is loaded but which needs a call of
<Ref Func="LoadPackage"/> before you can use the described functions.
<P/>
<Index>table of sections for help books</Index>
<C>?[<A>book</A>:]sections</C>
<P/>
<Index>table of chapters for help books</Index>
<C>?[<A>book</A>:][chapters]</C>
<P/>
These commands  show tables of  content for all available,  respectively the
matching books.
<P/>
<Index>redisplay a help section</Index>
<C>?</C>
<P/>
<Index>redisplay with next help viewer</Index>
<C>?&amp;</C>
<P/>
These commands redisplay the last shown help section.
In the form <C>?&amp;</C> the next preferred help viewer is used for the
display (provided one has chosen several viewers),
see&nbsp;<Ref Func="SetHelpViewer"/> below.

<Heading>Changing the Help Viewer</Heading>

<Index>document formats (text, dvi, ps, pdf, HTML)</Index>

Books  of the  &GAP;  help  system can  be  available  in several  formats.
Currently the following formats occur (not  all of them may be available for
all books):
<P/>
<List>
<Mark>text</Mark>
<Item>
  This is used for display in the terminal window in which &GAP; is
  running. Complicated mathematical expressions may not be well readable in
  this format.
</Item>
<Mark>dvi</Mark>
<Item>
  The standard output  format of &TeX;. Only useful if  &TeX; is installed
  on your system. Can be used for printing a help book and onscreen reading.
  Some  books include  hyperlink information  in  this format  which can  be
  useful for onscreen reading.
</Item>
<Mark>ps</Mark>
<Item>
  Postscript format. Can be printed on most systems and also be used with an 
  onscreen viewer.
</Item>
<Mark>pdf</Mark>
<Item>
  Adobe's <C>pdf</C> format. Can be used for printing and onscreen reading
  on most current systems (with freely available software).
  Some books have hyperlink information included in this format.
</Item>
<Mark>HTML</Mark>
<Item>
  The format of web pages.  Can be used with any web browser.  There may be
  hyperlink information available which allows a convenient browsing through
  the book via cross-references. This format has the problem that
  complicated formulae may be not well readable since there is no syntax for
  formulae in  HTML. Some books  use special  symbol fonts for  formulae and
  need an appropriate web browser for correct display.
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
Depending on your operating system and available additional software you can
use several of  these formats with &GAP;'s online help.  This is configured
with the following command.


<ManSection>
<Func Name="SetHelpViewer" Arg='viewer1, viewer2, ...'/>

<Description>
This command  takes an arbitrary number  of arguments which must  be strings
describing a viewer. The recognized viewers are explained below. A call with
no arguments shows the current setting.
<P/>
The first  given arguments  are those  with higher priority.  So, if  a help
section is available in the format needed by <A>viewer1</A>,
this viewer is used.
If not, availability of the format for <A>viewer2</A> is checked and so on.
Recall that the command <C>?&amp;</C> displays the last seen section again
but with the next possible viewer in your list,
see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="Browsing through the Sections"/>.
<P/>
The viewer <C>"screen"</C> (see below) is always silently appended since we
assume that each help book is available in text format.
<P/>
If you want to change the default setting you will probably put a call of
<Ref Func="SetHelpViewer"/> into your <F>.gaprc</F> file
(see&nbsp;<Ref Sect="The .gaprc file"/>).
<P/>
<List>
<Mark><C>"screen"</C></Mark>
<Item>
  This is the default setting. The help is shown in text format using the
  <Ref Func="Pager"/> command.
  Hint:
  Some formatting procedures assume that your terminal displays at least 80
  characters per line, if this is not the case some sections may look very
  bad. Furthermore the terminal (window) should use a fixed width font and
  we suggest to take one with <C>ISO-8859-1</C> (also called <C>latin1</C>)
  encoding.
</Item>
<Mark><C>"firefox"</C>, <C>"mozilla"</C>, <C>"netscape"</C>, <C>"konqueror"</C></Mark>
<Item>
  If a book is available in HTML format this is shown using the
  corresponding web browser.
  How well this works, for example by using a running instance of this
  browser, depends on your particular start script of this browser.
  Note, that for some books the browser must be configured
  to use symbol fonts.
</Item>
<Mark><C>"browser"</C></Mark>
<Item>
  (for MS Windows) If a book is available in HTML format, it will be 
  opened using the Windows default application (typically, a web browser).
</Item>
<Mark><C>"w3m"</C>, <C>"lynx"</C></Mark>
<Item>
  If a book is available in HTML format this is shown using the text based
  <C>w3m</C> or <C>lynx</C> web browser inside the terminal running &GAP;.
  Formulae which use symbol fonts may be unreadable.
</Item>
<Mark><C>"mac default browser"</C>, <C>"safari"</C></Mark>
<Item>
  (for Apple Macintosh) If a book is available in HTML format this is shown
  in a web browser.
  The web browser used is the program set to handle the <C>file</C> protocol
  in the <C>Internet</C> control panel (System 9  and System X).
  For some browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer), you may have to enter the
  &GAP; command <C>HELP_MAC_PROTOCOL := "file:/";</C>
  for this to work correctly.
  If you wish to use the online HTML version of the manual, you may use
  <C>HELP_EXTERNAL_URL := "http://www.gap-system.org/";</C>. Note that
  <C>HELP_EXTERNAL_URL := "";</C> switches back to the local HTML files.
  It may be a good idea to put the relevant line in the <F>gap.rc</F> file
  (see <Ref Sect="The .gaprc file"/>).
</Item>
<Mark><C>"xdvi"</C></Mark>
<Item>
  (on X-windows systems) If a book is available in dvi format it is shown
  with the onscreen viewer program <C>xdvi</C>.
  (Of course, <C>xdvi</C> and &TeX; must be installed on your system.)
  This program doesn't allow remote commands, so usually for each shown topic
  a new <C>xdvi</C> is launched.
  You can try to compile the program <C>GAPPATH/etc/xrmtcmd.c</C> and to put
  the executable <C>xrmtcmd</C> into your <C>PATH</C>.
  Then this viewer tries to reuse one running <C>xdvi</C> for each help book.
</Item>
<Mark><C>"xpdf"</C></Mark>
<Item>
  (on X-windows systems) If a book is available in pdf format it is shown
  with the onscreen viewer program <C>xpdf</C>
  (which must be installed on your system).
  This is a nice program, once it is running it is reused by &GAP; for the
  next displays of help sections.
  (Hint: On many systems <C>xpdf</C> shows a very bad display quality,
  this is due to a wrong or missing font configuration.
  One needs to set certain X-resources; for more details follow the
  <C>Problems</C> link at <URL>http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/</URL>.
</Item>
<Mark><C>"acroread"</C></Mark>
<Item>
  If a book is available in pdf format it is shown with the onscreen viewer
  program <C>acroread</C> (which must be available on your system).
  This program doesn't allow remote commands or startup with a given page.
  Therefore the page numbers you have to visit are just printed on the
  screen.
  When you are looking at several sections of the same book, this viewer
  assumes that the <C>acroread</C> window still exists.
  When you go to another book a new acroread window is launched.
</Item>
<Mark><C>"less"</C> or <C>"more"</C></Mark>
<Item>
  This is the same as <C>"screen"</C> but additionally the <C>PAGER</C> and
  <C>PAGER_OPTIONS</C>  variables are set,
  see the section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="The Pager Command"/> for more details.

<Section Label="The Pager Command">
<Heading>The Pager Command</Heading>

&GAP; contains a builtin pager which  shows a text string which doesn't fit
on  the screen  page  by page.  Its functionality  is  very rudimentary  and
self-explaining. This  is because (at  least under UNIX) there  are powerful
external standard programs which do this job.


<ManSection>
<Func Name="Pager" Arg='lines'/>

<Description>
This function can be  used to display a text on screen  using a pager, i.e.,
the text is shown page by page.
<P/>
There is a default builtin pager  in GAP which has very limited capabilities
but should work on any system.
<P/>
At least  on a  UNIX system one  should use an  external pager  program like
<C>less</C> or <C>more</C>.
&GAP; assumes that this program has a command line option <C>+nr</C>
which starts the display of the text with line number <C>nr</C>.
<P/>
Which pager is used can be controlled by setting the variable <C>PAGER</C>.
The default setting is <C>PAGER := "builtin";</C> which means that
the internal pager is used.
<P/>
On UNIX systems you probably want to set <C>PAGER := "less";</C> or
<C>PAGER := "more";</C>, you can do this for example in your <F>.gaprc</F>
file (see <Ref Sect="The .gaprc file"/>).
In that case you can also tell &GAP; a list of standard options for the
external pager.
These are specified as list of strings in the variable <C>PAGER_OPTIONS</C>.
<P/>
Example:
<Log><![CDATA[
  PAGER := "less";
  PAGER_OPTIONS := ["-f", "-r", "-a", "-i", "-M", "-j2"];
]]></Log>
<P/>
The argument <A>lines</A> can have one of the following forms:
<P/>
<Enum>
<Item>
 a string (i.e., lines are separated by newline characters)
</Item>
<Item>
 a list of strings (without  newline characters) 
which are interpreted as lines of the text to be shown
</Item>
<Item>
 a record with component <C>lines</C> as in 1. or 2. and 
optional further components
</Item>
</Enum>
<P/>
In case&nbsp;3. currently the following additional components are used:
<P/>
<List>
<Mark><C>formatted</C></Mark>
<Item>
  can be <K>false</K> or <K>true</K>.
  If set to <K>true</K> the builtin pager tries to show the text exactly as
  it is given (avoiding &GAP;'s automatic line breaking),
</Item>
<Mark><C>start</C></Mark>
<Item>
  must be a positive integer. This is interpreted as the number of the first
  line shown by  the pager (one may see the beginning of the text via back
  scrolling).
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
The <Ref Func="Pager"/> command is used by &GAP;'s help system for displaying
help sections in text format.
But, of course, it may be used for other purposes as well.
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
gap> s6 := SymmetricGroup(6);;
gap> words := ["This", "is", "a", "very", "stupid", "example"];;
gap> l := List(s6, p-> Permuted(words, p));;

<!-- %%  examples do not seem to agree with your interpretation of the -->
<!-- %%  explanations, use <C>?</C> to read the whole section again from the beginning. -->

<!-- %%  Upper and lower case in <A>section</A> are not distinguished, so typing either -->
<!-- %%  <C>?Abbreviating Section Names</C> or <C>?abbreviating section names</C> will show -->
<!-- %%  the section you are currently reading. -->
<!-- %%   -->
<!-- %%  Each word in <A>section</A> may be abbreviated. So instead of typing -->
<!-- %%  <C>?abbreviating section names</C> you may also type <C>?abb sec nam</C>, or even <C>?a -->
<!-- %%  s n</C>. You must not omit the spaces separating the words. For each word in -->
<!-- %%  the section name you must give at least the first character. As another -->
<!-- %%  example you may type <C>?el oper for int</C> instead of <C>?elementary operations -->
<!-- %%  for integers</C>, which is especially handy when you can not remember whether -->
<!-- %%  it was <C>operations</C> or <C>operators</C>. -->
<!-- %%   -->
<!-- %%  If an abbreviation matches multiple section names a list of all these -->
<!-- %%  section names is displayed. -->

<!-- %%  The first part of each line is a reference number.  Then follows the -->

<!-- %%   -->
<!-- %%  The order of the sections corresponds to their order in the -->
<!-- %%  &GAP; manual, so that related sections should be adjacent. -->
<!-- %%   -->
<!-- %%  You can then either refer to the desired subsection by its name or simply -->
<!-- %%  use <C>?<A>nr</A></C> to look at the topic with the reference number <A>nr</A>. So in the -->
<!-- %%  above example <C>?3</C> would display the section on <C>ReadLib</C>. -->
<!-- %%   -->
<!-- %%  When referring to sections by their name you can usually omit the part -->
<!-- %%  of the manual unless several parts contain the same section names. -->
<!-- %%   -->
<!-- %%  If there are several subsections which have exactly the same name, a number -->
<!-- %%  in parentheses is added to the name to distinguish these. -->
