<Heading>Replaced and Removed Command Names</Heading>

<Index>obsolete</Index>
<Index>deprecated</Index>
<Index>legacy</Index>

In general we try to keep &GAP;&nbsp;4 compatible with former releases
as much as possible.
Nevertheless, from time to time it seems appropriate to remove some commands
or to change the names of some commands or variables.
There are various reasons for that:
Some functionality was improved and got another (hopefully better) interface,
names turned out to be too special or too general for the underlying
functionality,
or names are found to be unintuitive or inconsistent with other names.
<P/>
In this chapter we collect such old names while pointing to the sections
which explain how to substitute them.
Usually, old names will be available for several releases;
they may be removed when they don't seem to be used any more.

<Section Label="Group Actions - Name Changes">
<Heading>Group Actions &ndash; Name Changes</Heading>

<Index>group operations</Index>

The concept of a group action is sometimes referred to as a
<Q>group operation</Q>.
In &GAP;&nbsp;3 as well as in older versions of &GAP;&nbsp;4 the term
<C>Operation</C> was used instead of <C>Action</C>.
We decided to change the names to avoid confusion with the term
<Q>operation</Q> as in <Ref Func="DeclareOperation"/> and
<Q>operations for Xyz</Q>.
<P/>
Here are some examples of such name changes.

<Section Label="Package Interface - Obsolete Functions and Name Changes">
<Heading>Package Interface &ndash; Obsolete Functions and Name Changes</Heading>

With &GAP;&nbsp;4.4 the package interface was changed. Thereby some functions
became obsolete and the names of some others were made more consistent.
<P/>
<Index Key="DeclarePackage"><C>DeclarePackage</C></Index>
<Index Key="DeclareAutoPackage"><C>DeclareAutoPackage</C></Index>
<Index Key="DeclarePackageDocumentation">
<C>DeclarePackageDocumentation</C></Index>
<Index Key="DeclarePackageAutoDocumentation">
<C>DeclarePackageAutoDocumentation</C></Index>
The following functions are no longer needed:
<C>DeclarePackage</C>,
<C>DeclareAutoPackage</C>,
<C>DeclarePackageDocumentation</C> and 
<C>DeclarePackageAutoDocumentation</C>.
They are substituted by entries in the packages' <F>PackageInfo.g</F> files,
see <Ref Sect="The PackageInfo.g File"/>. 
<P/>
The following function names were changed.

<Section Label="Normal Forms of Integer Matrices - Name Changes">
<Heading>Normal Forms of Integer Matrices &ndash; Name Changes</Heading>

<Index>Smith normal form</Index>
<Index>Hermite normal form</Index>

Former versions of &GAP;&nbsp;4 documented several functions for computing
the Smith or Hermite normal form of integer matrices.
Some of them were never implemented and it was unclear which commands to use.
The functionality of all of these commands is now available with
<Ref Func="NormalFormIntMat"/> and a few interface functions.

<Index Key="BANNER"><C>BANNER</C></Index>
<Index Key="GAPInfo"><C>GAPInfo</C></Index>

In former releases of &GAP;&nbsp;4 there were some global variable names
bound to general information about the running &GAP;,
such as path names or command line options.
Although they were not officially documented they were used by several users
and in some packages.
We mention here <C>BANNER</C> and <C>QUIET</C>.
This type of information is now collected in a record with name
<C>GAPInfo</C> and will become documented after a test phase.

Here are some further name changes.
