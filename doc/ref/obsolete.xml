<Heading>Group Actions &ndash; Name Changes</Heading>

<Index>group operations</Index>

The concept of a group action is sometimes referred to as a
<Q>group operation</Q>.
In &GAP;&nbsp;3 as well as in older versions of &GAP;&nbsp;4 the term
<C>Operation</C> was used instead of <C>Action</C>.
We decided to change the names to avoid confusion with the term
<Q>operation</Q> as in <Ref Func="DeclareOperation"/> and
<Q>operations for Xyz</Q>.
<P/>
Here are some examples of such name changes.

<Index Key="Operation"><C>Operation</C></Index>

<Section Label="Package Interface - Obsolete Functions and Name Changes">
<Heading>Package Interface &ndash; Obsolete Functions and Name Changes</Heading>

With &GAP;&nbsp;4.4 the package interface was changed. Thereby some functions
became obsolete and the names of some others were made more consistent.
<P/>
<Index Key="DeclarePackage"><C>DeclarePackage</C></Index>
<Index Key="DeclareAutoPackage"><C>DeclareAutoPackage</C></Index>
<Index Key="DeclarePackageDocumentation">
<C>DeclarePackageDocumentation</C></Index>
<Index Key="DeclarePackageAutoDocumentation">
<C>DeclarePackageAutoDocumentation</C></Index>
The following functions are no longer needed:
<C>DeclarePackage</C>,
<C>DeclareAutoPackage</C>,
<C>DeclarePackageDocumentation</C> and 
<C>DeclarePackageAutoDocumentation</C>.
They are substituted by entries in the packages' <F>PackageInfo.g</F> files,
see <Ref Sect="The PackageInfo.g File"/>. 
<P/>
Furthermore, the global variable <C>PACKAGES_VERSIONS</C> is no longer needed,
since this information is now contained in the <C>GAPInfo.PackagesInfo</C> record
(see <Ref Subsect="GAPInfo"/>).
<P/>

The following function names were changed.

<Section Label="Normal Forms of Integer Matrices - Name Changes">
<Heading>Normal Forms of Integer Matrices &ndash; Name Changes</Heading>

<Index>Smith normal form</Index>
<Index>Hermite normal form</Index>

Former versions of &GAP;&nbsp;4 documented several functions for computing
the Smith or Hermite normal form of integer matrices.
Some of them were never implemented and it was unclear which commands to use.
The functionality of all of these commands is now available with
<Ref Func="NormalFormIntMat"/> and a few interface functions.

<Heading>Miscellaneous Name Changes or Removed Names</Heading>

<Index Key="QUIET"><C>QUIET</C></Index>
<Index Key="BANNER"><C>BANNER</C></Index>

In former releases of &GAP;&nbsp;4 there were some global variable names
bound to general information about the running &GAP;,
such as path names or command line options.
Although they were not officially documented they were used by several users
and in some packages.
We mention here <C>BANNER</C> and <C>QUIET</C>.
This type of information is now collected in the global record
<Ref Var="GAPInfo"/>.
<P/>
Here are some further name changes.

<Section Label="obsolete-gaprc">
<Heading>The former .gaprc file</Heading>

Up to &GAP;&nbsp;4.4, a file <F>.gaprc</F> in the user's home directory
(if available) was read automatically during startup,
early enough for influencing the autoloading of packages and
late enough for being allowed to execute any &GAP; code.
<P/>
In &GAP;&nbsp;4.5, the order in which files are read on startup has changed.
Because of that (and in order to provide better support for workspaces),
&GAP; now supports in each of its root directories one file <F>gap.ini</F>,
which is read early but may contain only very restricted assignments,
and one file <F>gaprc</F>,
which is read after starting &GAP; but before reading the files given
on the command line.
The latter file can be used only for initializations after startup,
for example reading personal files, it cannot influence the startup of &GAP;.
See <Ref Sect="sect:gap.ini"/> for details.
<P/>
For the sake of partial backwards compatibility,
also the former file <F>~/.gaprc</F> is still supported for such
initializations, but this file is read only if no <F>gaprc</F> file
is found in the &GAP; root directories,
and <F>~/.gaprc</F> is read at the same time as <F>gaprc</F>
would be read, i.&nbsp;e., too late for influencing the startup of &GAP;.
<P/>
As before, the command line option <C>-r</C> disables reading
<F>~/.gaprc</F>, see <Ref Sect="Command Line Options"/>.
