Entries in     `typewriter style' refer  to   {\GAP}  functions (e.g.,
`Size'); entries in roman type   refer to {\GAP}-specific concepts.  A
page number in  {\it italics} denotes a  whole section which is  named
like the   index  entry.  For  mathematical terms,    especially their
definitions, see   the glossary in  appendix~A. For  references to the
algorithms implemented in {\GAP}, see the bibliography in appendix~B.

Keywords   are   sorted  with    case  and   spaces    ignored,  e.g.,
```PermutationCharacter''' comes before ``permutation group''.
