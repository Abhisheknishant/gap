Entries  in   `typewriter  style' refer   to  {\GAP} functions  (e.g.,
`Size'); entries in roman type refer to {\GAP}-specific concepts. Page
numbers are given in the form <chapter>--<page_within_chapter>. A page
number in  {\it italics} denotes a  whole section  which is named like
the index entry. For mathematical terms, especially their definitions,
see  the   glossary in appendix~A.  For   references to the algorithms
implemented in {\GAP}, see the bibliography in appendix~B.

Keywords   are   sorted  with    case  and   spaces    ignored,  e.g.,
```PermutationCharacter''' comes before ``permutation group''.
