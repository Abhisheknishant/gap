<P/>
If you obtain &GAP; please send us  a short notice to that effect, e.g.,
an  e-mail  message   to  the  address  <Email>support@gap-system.org</Email>,
containing your full  name and address.  This  allows us to keep track of
the number of &GAP; users.
<P/>
If you  publish  a mathematical  result  that  was  partly obtained using
&GAP;, please cite &GAP;, just as you would cite another paper that you
used (see below for sample citation). Also   we would appreciate if you
could inform us  about such a paper.

<P/>
&GAP; is distributed by us without any warranty, to the extent permitted
by applicable state law.  We  distribute &GAP; <E>as is</E> without  warranty
of any kind, either expressed or implied, including,  but not limited to,
the implied  warranties  of merchantability and  fitness for a particular
purpose.
<P/>
The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is  with
you.  Should &GAP; prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary
servicing, repair or correction.
<P/>
In no  case  unless  required by applicable law will we, and/or any other
party who  may  modify  and  redistribute  &GAP;  as permitted above, be
liable  to you for damages, including lost profits, lost monies or  other
special, incidental or consequential damages  arising out  of the  use or
inability to use &GAP;.
<P/>
You  are permitted  to modify and  redistribute  &GAP;,  but you are not
allowed  to restrict further redistribution.  That is to say  proprietary
modifications will  not  be allowed.  We want all  versions  of &GAP; to
remain free.
<P/>
If you  modify any part of &GAP; and redistribute it,  you must supply a
<F>README</F>  document.   This should specify what modifications you made  in
which  files.  We do  not  want  to take  credit  or  be blamed  for your
modifications.
<P/>
Of course we are interested in all of your modifications.  In  particular
we would like to see bug-fixes, improvements and new functions.  So again
we would appreciate it if you would inform us about all modifications you
make.
<P/>
In addition to the general copyright for &GAP; set forth above,
the following terms apply to the versions of &GAP; for Windows.
<P/>
The executable of &GAP; for Windows that we distribute was compiled with
the <C>gnuwin32</C> compiler of the <C>cygwin</C> package. 
This compiler can be obtained by anonymous <C>ftp</C> from a
variety of general public FTP archives. Many thanks to the Free Software
Foundation and RedHat Software for this amazing piece of work.
<P/>
The GNU C compiler is

<P/>
under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
<P/>
The Cygwin32 API library is also covered by the GNU GPL. The executable we
provide is linked against this library (and in the process includes
GPL'd Cygwin32 glue code). This means that the executable falls under
the GPL too, which it does anyhow.
<P/>
The <F>cygwin1.dll</F>, <F>libW11.dll</F>, <F>rxvt.exe</F> and <F>regtool.exe</F> binaries are
taken unmodified from the Cygwin distribution. They are copyright by RedHat Software
and released under the GPL. You can find more information about <C>cygwin</C> under
<URL>http://www.cygwin.com</URL>. You also will be able to obtain the sources for <C>cygwin</C> from this place.
