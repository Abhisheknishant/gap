\Chapter Index

Page numbers are given in the form <chapter>--<page_within_chapter>. A
page number  in {\it  italics}  refers  to  a  whole section which  is
devoted to the indexed subject. Some index entries refer to exercises,
whose answers in appendix~A  should then  also  be read. Keywords  are
sorted with case  and spaces ignored, e.g., ```PermutationCharacter'''
comes before ``permutation group''.
