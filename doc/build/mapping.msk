\Section{Structure preserving mappings}

From an algebraical point of view, the most important mappings are those
which preserve a structure. {\GAP} supports four types of such mappings:

1. General mappings that respect multiplication

2. General mappings that respect addition

3. General mappings that respect scalar mult.

4. General mappings that respect multiplicative and additive structure
