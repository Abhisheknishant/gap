<Heading>Changes between &GAP; 4.5 and &GAP; 4.6 (BETA FOR PACKAGE AUTHORS)</Heading>

This chapter lists most important changes between &GAP; 4.5.7 and the
first public release of &GAP; 4.6. Later it will also contain information 
about subsequent update releases for &GAP; 4.5.

<Section Label="fix460"> 

<Heading>&GAP; 4.6.0 (Winter 2012/2013)</Heading>

Improved and extended functionality:
<List>  
<Item>
It is now possible to declare a name as an operation with 
two or more arguments (possibly several times) and <E>THEN</E> declare
it as an attribute. Previously this was only possible in 
the other order. This should make the system more independent of 
the order in which packages are loaded.
</Item>
<Item>
Words in fp groups are now printed in factorised form if possible and not
too time-consuming.
</Item>       
<Item>
Added methods to calculate Hall subgroups in nonsolvable groups.
</Item>
<Item>
Added a generic method for <Ref Prop="IsPSolvable" BookName="ref"/> and 
better generic method for <Ref Prop="IsPNilpotent" BookName="ref"/> for 
groups. 
</Item>
<Item>
Improvements to action homomorphisms: image of an element can use existing 
stabiliser chain of the image group (to reduce the number of images to 
compute), preimages under linear/projective action homomorphisms use 
linear algebra to avoid factorisation.
</Item>
<Item>
To improve efficiency, additional code was added to make sure that the 
<C>HomePcgs</C> of a permutation group is in <C>IsPcgsPermGroupRep</C> 
representation in more cases.
</Item>
<Item>
Added an operation <Ref Oper="SortBy" BookName="ref"/> with argument being
a function <A>f</A> of one argument and a list <A>l</A> to be sorted so 
that <C><A>l</A>(<A>f</A>[i]) &lt;= <A>l</A>(<A>f</A>[i+1])</C>.
</Item>
<Item>
Added a kernel function <C>MEET_BLIST</C> which returns <K>true</K> if the 
two boolean lists have <K>true</K> in any common position and <K>false</K> 
otherwise. This is useful for representing subsets of a fixed set by boolean
lists.
</Item>
<Item>
When assigning to a position in a compressed FFE vector &GAP; now checks to 
see if the value being assigned can be converted into an internal FFE 
element if it isn't one already. Uses new attribute 
<Ref Oper="AsInternalFFE" BookName="ref"/>, for which 
methods are installed for internal FFEs, Conway FFEs and ZmodpZ objects.
</Item>
<Item>
Replaced <Ref Oper="ViewObj" BookName="ref"/> method for fields by 
<Ref Oper="ViewString" BookName="ref"/> method to improve the way
how polynomial rings over algebraic extenstions of fields are displayed.
</Item>
<Item>
Made the info string (optional 2nd argument to 
<Ref Func="InstallImmediateMethod" BookName="ref"/>) 
behave similarly to the info string in 
<Ref Func="InstallMethod" BookName="ref"/>.
In particular, <Ref Func="TraceImmediateMethods" BookName="ref"/>
now always prints the name of the operation.
</Item>
<Item>
Syntax errors such as <C>Unbind(x,1)</C> had the unhelpful
property that <C>x</C> got unbound before the syntax error
was reported. A specific check was added to catch this and
similar cases a little earlier.
</Item>
<Item>
Allow a <C>GAPARGS</C> parameter to the top-level &GAP; <F>Makefile</F> to pass
extra arguments to the &GAP; used for manual building.
</Item>
</List>

Fixed bugs which could lead to crashes:
<List>              
<Item>
The extremely old <C>DEBUG_DEADSONS_BAGS</C> compile-time
option has not worked correctly for many years and indeed crashes &GAP;.
The type of bug it is there to detect has not arisen in many years and we 
have certainly not used this option, so it has been removed.

Other fixed bugs:

<List>
<Item>
Scanning of floating point literals collided with iterated use of integers 
as record field elements in expressions like <C>r.1.2</C>.
</Item>
<Item>
Fixed two potential problems in <C>NorSerPermPcgs</C>, one corrupting
some internal data and one possibly mixing up different pcgs. 
</Item>
</List>

New packages added for the redistribution with &GAP;:
