Generic groups
@Descr
<P>
Many newer algorithms reduce to the case of an almost simple group.
Furthermore much information is known about these groups. To do this in
practice, however, one needs 
</P>

<UL>
<LI> constructive recognition routines for the various types of groups
<LI> stored information about the groups
<LI> A ``default'' mechanism for transferring information.
</UL>

<P>
Some rountines have been (at least partially) implemented, the library of
tables of marks also contains much information about subgroups.
</P>

<P>
Getting complete information for all simple groups is likely to be beyond
one persons scope, a reasonable goal would be to provide routines and data
for single series of groups or all almost simple groups up to size 1
million.
