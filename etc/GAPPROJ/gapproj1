<P>
Sylow complements and Hall subgroups are presently found only for finite soluble
groups. However while a finite group is soluble iff *all* Sylow complements
exist, nonsoluble finite groups may have Sylow complements for *some* primes p.
(e.g. an alternating group of degree p contains a p Sylow complement.)

<P>
The trivial idea to form products of Sylow subgroups obviously is not efficient.
Are there methods (such as have been found for  Sylow subgroups) to find Sylow
complements and more generally Hall subgroups? 
</P>

<P>
To my knowledge not much is known about the existence of Sylow  complements in
nonsoluble groups, hence to be able to investigate them in examples might be
interesting.

<P>
For computing, a lifting aproach via the radical would be possible.
