@Descr
The implemented polynomial arithmetic was intended to be sufficiently good
for occasional calculations but is probably not good enough for serious
commutative algebra (such as Gr"obner basis calculations).

The easiest first step is to simply precompile `ratfun1.gi', but for better
improvements it could be desirable to recode more routines genuinely in the
kernel and probably even to change the internal data structure.

@Rem
Care needs to be taken to keep the old interface functions to avoid having
to rewrite all code that uses polynomials.
