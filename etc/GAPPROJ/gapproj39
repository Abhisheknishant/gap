@Descr
Implement a function that tries to decompose a group via ``standard''
constructions (direct product, semidirect product, probably more).
<P>
If the constituent parts could be identified this also gives the option of
assigning a (not isomorphism type determining) ``name'' to a group.
<P>
This is partially implemented for 4.5 but very inefficient.
