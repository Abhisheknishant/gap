@Descr
The existing partition backtrack code has the following serious problems:

<P>
The code does not separate algorithms and data structures, but relies
extensively on a particular (memory intensive) partition data structure. For
groups of degree over 100000, this poses severe problems in terms of memory
usage.

Changing the data structure is not possible as the code relies on particular
component access and particular functionality.

<P>
there are often requests for further backtrack functionality. Alas the
documentation does not seem to be sufficient for understanding how to
interface to the existing code, and the code is not the most readable. Given
the problems mentioned above it might be easier to rewrite, than to try to
understand and adapt.

<P>
Performance still seems to lack in comparison with for example Jeffrey Leons
Code.

Many combinatoric and ``search''-type applications.
