@Descr
At the moment GAP only provides finite fields up to size 2^16. This should
be extended.

It might be necessary to distinguish fields up to another limited size and
fields of larger size differently by their internal representation for
performance reasons.

@Application
This is an often requested feature. Matrix group recognition is an obvious
application.
