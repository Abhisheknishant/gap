@Descr
The existing ANUPQ interface has bugs that seem to be unresolvable. Instead
of trying to understand the code and clean it up it might be easier and more
desirable to rewrite the ANUPQ completely in GAP.

There is already an existing PQ in GAP whose performance seems to be
sufficient; what would be needed is to add functionality for Descendants and
Isomorphism test.

@Application
The ANUPQ functionality is quite desirable and we know of several people who
use Magma just because of this feature.
