<P>
With  the  ITC there is a 'shortcut' function that  from  a
definition sequence  that has led to  closure tries to  find a shorter
definition sequence that also does the trick. Its working is explained
in the ITC manual.

<P>
This functionality should have better uses: When one does MTC  to find a
subgroup presentation, the  presentation obtained obviously depends on the
definition sequence, and it sounds at least plausible that a short
definition  sequence might  be advantageous.   So it would be useful to
provide an extended interface to the MTC that allows to  feed  in a
definition  sequence  obtained  elsewhere.  ITC  after 'shortcut' could be
one possibility.

<P>
But also so far ACE lacks an output of the definition sequence that it
has used. 
In principle it should be possible to take this from the
the code of ACE, all one had to do is
to  keep  an  additional  list  in  which  one  keeps  record  of  the
definitions  made. If  one got  that out  of ACE  one could  then even
filter it through a 'shortcut' function.
