<P>
Currently it is in general difficult to find out what ``arguments''
GAP used to decide a given question.
It would be desirable to support a `Why' mechanism that gives some
information about what GAP did.

(The Magnus system has such a feature; in particular when concurrent
strategies are used in parallel for one given question,
it is reasonable to tell the user which one finally succeeded.)
</P>

Clearly the problem gets easier the more local it is stated.
<DL>
<DT>1.
<DD>
 A low level approach is used by some functions in the Chapter
   ``Monomiality Questions'', roughly speaking they return not the
   result in question but a record with this result and an info string.
<DT>2.
<DD>
The next release will contain an experimental version of a
   ``history'' for calculations with group characters;
   that is, characters arising from a set of (marked) initial characters
   by a prescribed set of operations will know how they can be expressed
   in terms of the initial characters.
   (This is a somewhat different issue than the `Why' mentioned above
   but belongs to the same problem.)
</DL>

For an overall approach of `Why', one could think of something similar
to `TraceMethods', just one does something not when a method is called
but when a method returns some result (different from `TryNextMethod()');
moreover, this result is interesting only if it belongs to the call with
the argument entered by the user (or entered at not too deep recursion
leves, if several `Why' levels are supported).

<P>
Probably some better ideas are needed before one can start to implement
something concerning this wish.
