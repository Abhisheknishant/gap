@Descr
<P>
The algorithm by M. Smith for the automorphism group of a solvable group can
be (and has been by Cannon and Holt) generalized to the nonsolvable case and
also generalized to isomorphism computation.
</P>

<P>
The automorphism algorithm is in preparation, the isomorphism variant is not
yet done.
</P>

<HR>
A further improvements would be to use pretabulated information for almost
simple subgroups
