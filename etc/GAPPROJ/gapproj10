@Descr
<P>
The algorithm by M. Smith for the automorphism group of a solvable group can
be (and has been by cannon and Holt) generalized to the nonsolvable case.
</P>

<P>
Again one starts with the automorphism group of G/Rad(G) and then lifts via
elementary abelian factors to the whole of G.
</P>

<P>
The same approach also yields a better isomorphism test.
</P>
<HR>
A further improvements would be to use pretabulated information for almost
simple subgroups

This project requires module automorphisms
