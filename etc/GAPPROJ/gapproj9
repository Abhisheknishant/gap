@Descr
<P>
The ``elementary abelian extension'' algorithm for the lattice of a
subgroups of a solvable group has an obvious generalization to nonsolvable
groups by computing the subgropups of the factor G/Rad(G) by cyclic
extension and then lifting the subgroups by complement calculation.
</P>

<P>
This would be faster and further reaching than a pure cyclic extension.
</P>

<P>
(The only slightly subtle point is inclusion of conjugates)
</P>
<HR>
A further improvements would be to use pretabulated information for almost
simple subgroups
