@Descr
At the moment GAP uses its own long integer arithmetic. Replacing this by
the (higher optimized) GNU multiprecision arithmetic (GMP) should provide an
overall speedup to all routines using integer arithmetic.
<P>

Care needs to be taken of the following issues:
<UL>
<LI>
If the GMP library uses malloc, this has to be integrated with the GAP
memory manager.
<LI>
For performance reasons it is crucial to represent small integers as
immediate objects, as is done already. This means that GMP is only called if
the result of a calculation will be too large and that a GMP result must be
converted into an immediate integer if it is sufficiently small
