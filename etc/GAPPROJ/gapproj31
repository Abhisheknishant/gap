@Descr
At the moment we support two manual formats: The ``classic'' format and
GAPDoc. Given the state of the classic format which is basically a
collection of hacks, it would be desirable to change to GAPDoc.

<P>
To do so will require first a tool for a rough automatic translation of
manual sections but given the unparsability of the old format a human has to
look over the result. For most lines this is trivial, but still a lot of
work is left.

<P>
The gain would be that we would not have to support the old tools and the
old format any longer and would gain better manual features.
