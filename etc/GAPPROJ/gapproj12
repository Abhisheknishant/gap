@Descr
The MeatAxe in GAP contains routines for isomorphism of simple modules,
however not for the full automorphism group of an arbitrary module.
Such an automorphism group would be desirable as a subroutine in various
places, for example in the calculation of the automorphism group of a
group.
@Ref
@Rem
The MAGMA implementation is based on ideas by Leedham-Green, but apparently
little has been published.
<P>
Implemented for 4.5. AH
