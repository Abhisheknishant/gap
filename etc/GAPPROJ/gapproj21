@Descr
<P>
The existing matrix routines (Determinant, Inverse) often use implicitly,
that the underlying ring is commutative and an integral domain or even that
every nonzero element is invertible.
</P>
<P>
As some people want to work with matrices over other rings, it would be nice
to have more general (albeit slower) routines that do not require quotients.
</P>

<P>
This change should be a pure add-on with interfering as little as possible
with the existing methods which need to be fast.
